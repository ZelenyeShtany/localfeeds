<media:description>Learn 7 words in English that are actually 14 words! These words can be either nouns or verbs, depending on where you put the stress when you pronounce the word. That means that these words are spelled the same, but have different functions depending on the way we say them. I’ll teach you the rule, go through the words and explain the noun and verb versions of each, and then we’ll do some practice. Let’s start!

<media:description>If you want people to enjoy speaking with you, you need to know when to end a conversation. English speakers won't tell you that they want to end a conversation, but we do use body language, tone, and other cues to indicate we're ready to move on. In this special lesson I'll teach you to read these signs, so you can end a conversation pleasantly and politely. You'll also learn simple English expressions that you can use to end a conversation politely when you want to stop speaking with someone. Test your understanding with the quiz: https://www.engvid.com/when-to-end-a-conversation/

<media:description>Animal expressions are very common in the English language. But in today’s lesson, I want to teach you some animal idioms that are specifically used to describe people. For example, if someone is “sheepish”, it means they are shy, nervous, and have no confidence. If someone is “chicken”, it means they are afraid. We will also look at the idiomatic meanings of “fishy”, “beef”, “pig”, “squirrely”, “sluggish”, and “snake”. When it comes to idioms, they are very useful because they allow you to use fewer words to express a broader meaning. And these commonly used animal expressions will come in handy when you are trying to describe people you meet and situations that you encounter with them. So watch the lesson to learn some useful English expressions, and then do the quiz to practice what you’ve learned. https://www.engvid.com/describe-people-in-english-animal-adjectives-idioms/

<media:description>“Sorry” or “excuse me”? You may think they mean the same thing, but there is a right time to use “excuse me”, and there is a right time to use “sorry”. They are both apologies but are used in different situations. In this lesson, I will teach you the difference between these two English expressions, when to use which, and how to use them properly. “Sorry” is an adjective that we use for feeling distress, sympathy, disappointment, and more. There are many other situations in which it is appropriate to use it, and I will cover them in this lesson. “Excuse me” is a phrase we use to get somebody’s attention, for interrupting, to judge with forgiveness, and more. I will give you examples for every situation. These are expressions you will be using almost every day, so it’s important to know the difference between the two. Take the quiz to solidify your knowledge, so you can apologize properly and with confidence every time. https://www.engvid.com/basic-english-sorry-excuse-me/

<media:description>What is the difference between “also”, “too”, and “as well”? You may think that they can be used at any time, but there are actually a few differences. In this English grammar lesson, we will look at those differences. First, I will teach you the meaning of each of these words and their function in a sentence. Hint: two of them are adverbs, and the other is a phrase. Then, I will show you how they are normally used, as well as some special cases. It’s important to know how to use these words in order to avoid sounding too repetitive. If you always use “too”, you can change it up and use “also” or “as well”, but you need to know how to use them correctly. So watch the lesson, and then do the quiz to practice what you’ve learned! https://www.engvid.com/basic-english-grammar-also-too-as-well/

<media:description>If you don’t have enough English fluency to have a conversation, you won’t get enough speaking practice. But if you don’t get enough English speaking practice, you won’t develop fluency. So how do you solve this problem? I will teach you four ways to practice conversation when you don’t have a partner to practice with. Seem impossible? Think again! I will teach you the principles of input/output, pacing, mimicking, and creative practice. You will be able to use these techniques to have frequent conversations and get the practice you need to become a fluent English speaker, even without a partner.

<media:description>Learn ten English idioms with the word “eye”! An idiom is an expression that is not predictable from the usual meaning of its words. For example, “to keep an eye on something” means that you watch something very carefully. In this lesson, I will teach you the meaning of many expressions, including “caught one’s eye”, “to have an eye for something”, “eyesore”, “pull the wool over someone’s eyes”, “more than meets the eye”, “an eye for an eye”, “keep one’s eyes peeled”, “keep an eye out for”, and “in the public eye”. These commonly used expressions will be useful to you in everyday life. Keep an eye out for the quiz after watching! https://www.engvid.com/10-english-idioms-expressions-eye/</media:description>

Now, an acronym is when you take the first letter of each word in a phrase and put them together. For example, “FYI” stands for “for your information”. We use acronyms and abbreviations frequently in English because we love shortening language. In this English vocabulary lesson, I will teach you 13 acronyms and abbreviations that will be very useful to you in everyday life. You will learn the meaning of “BTW”, “N/A”, “BRB”, “IMO”, “SOP”, “YTD”, “ROI”, “ETA”, and more. Most of these are used only in written form, but some can be used in spoken language, too. I’ll even show you a few slang acronyms that you will often see used on the Internet or in emails and text messages. Watch the lesson to learn a ton of useful vocabulary, and do the quiz to test yourself. https://www.engvid.com/13-common-acronyms-abbreviations-in-english/</media:description>

<media:title>W5 Questions in English: Wherever Whenever Whatever Whoever Whyever</media:title>

<media:description>The W5 are words in English that ask the questions where, when, what, who, and why. But when we add “ever” to the W5 word, it changes the meaning of the question. In this lesson, I will teach you the meaning of these questions. I will show you how adding “ever” at the end of the word expands its possibilities. For example, when we say, “Whoever did this is a genius”, we mean that we don’t know who it is, but it doesn’t matter because no matter who it is, that person is a genius. It is a broader statement than just answering the question “Who did this?” We can also use the W5 words as exclamations. “Whatever!” is a good example of an exclamation that expresses indifference or dismissal. Use these words in your everyday conversations, and you will be well on your way to sounding like a native English speaker! Whatever you do, don’t forget to do the quiz after watching to test your knowledge! https://www.engvid.com/wherever-whenever-whatever-whoever-whyever/</media:description>

<media:description>This lesson is all about English expressions that come from mixed martial arts and combat sports! But don’t assume all of the expressions I will teach you have to do with actual fighting. Rather, we use these expressions in everyday conversation when we talk about competition, challenges, and arguments. For example, when we say “throw your hat in the ring”, we are not talking about a boxing ring, but someone entering a competition or challenge. When we say “take it on the chin”, we are not talking about punches. It means to accept defeat without complaining. So as you can see, although some expressions come from the world of combat sports, they are commonly used in non-violent situations. Some other expressions we will look at include: “spoiling for a fight”, “the gloves are off”, “fight tooth and nail”, “uphill battle”, “throw in the towel”, “win hands down”, and more. So before you tap out, click the lesson, and do the quiz to test yourself.</media:description>

<media:description>This lesson is about more than just improving your vocabulary. Improve your communication skills and your conversations with others by replacing the simple “I know.” with other terms and expressions in English. In this video, I’ll explain why “I know” often has a negative effect on your conversation, and will then give you many different terms you can use instead. Take the first step to improving your relationships with friends, family, and co-workers by watching this class and then actually doing what I say in the video. Practice in real life and then let me know how it went in the comments.</media:description>

<media:description>I hate to tell you this, but we each have the responsibility to take care of ourselves. That’s right, my friend. As a responsible adult, you have a duty to pay your bills, to be on time, and to be a good person. In this lesson, we are going to talk about the words “responsibility”, “blame”, and “fault”. I will teach you their meanings and how they differ from -- and relate to -- each other. Each of these words is a facet of a problem. When you encounter a problem in your life, are you able to identify who is “to blame”? Is it always “someone else’s fault”? Or are you humble enough to “take responsibility”? Learn the difference by watching the lesson. If you don’t do the quiz after watching, don’t blame me for your lack of practice! https://www.engvid.com/vocabulary-life-tips-responsibility-blame-fault/</media:description>

<media:description>Did you know that by simply adding a preposition, you can transform normal verbs into phrasal verbs? Prepositions tell us the where, how, and why in a sentence. In this lesson, we will focus on the prepositions “off”, “on”, “over”, and “up” to form our phrasal verbs. Native English speakers like to use phrasal verbs because they contain the same amount of information as a long phrase does but in a small recognizable word pattern. For example, we can replace the phrase “research information online about something” with “look up”. You can also replace “contact someone to give them information” with “follow up”. So much more simple, right? Watch the lesson to find out what other phrasal verbs you can form with these prepositions. They will be useful to you in business and in everyday life.

<media:description>We often use shapes to describe things in English. Common shapes include squares, circles, and triangles. In this lesson, we are going to look at a few other shapes that may be less commonly used and more accurate. Some shapes may be a combination of other shapes. A “cone”, for example, is more or less a combination of a circle and a triangle. Some shapes are named after a particular object, like “egg shape”, “cigar shape”, and “sphere”. I will also teach you how to describe things using the adjective of the shape name. For example, we use “circular” for something that is in the shape of a circle. Lastly, we will go over some 3D shapes, as well as textures. This vocabulary lesson will be very useful to you in everyday life when describing things. Leave a comment in which you describe an object using one of these shape words.

<media:description>Using contractions is an essential part of sounding like a native English speaker. Some contractions are easier to understand than others. For example, “I will” becomes “I’ll”, and “I am” becomes “I’m”. But when looking at the contractions ‘s and ‘d, the many possibilities can lead to confusion. For example, is ‘s a contraction for “he has” or “he is”? Is ‘d a contraction for “she had” or “she would”? In this lesson, I will teach you how to use contractions correctly every time. Whether you are using the verb “to have”, “to be”, or other modal verbs, I will show you rules you can use to transform your verbs into contractions effortlessly. Plus, I will give plenty of examples to solidify your learning. After the lesson, take the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/contractions-for-have-be-would-will/</media:description>

<media:description>Do we say "We ate all the cake", "the entire cake", or "the whole cake"? What about "everyone in the room" or "each one in the room"? There are subtle differences between "whole", "all", "entire", "every", and "each" that even native English speakers may not be able to explain. In this lesson, we will address these differences and talk about when to use which. I will teach you what countable and uncountable nouns are, and that will help you understand which of these words to use in what context. I will also give you many examples to practice all of these. Don't forget to do the quiz after watching! https://www.engvid.com/learn-english-each-every-whole-entire-all/</media:description>

<media:description>Some first names in English can also mean something else. Sometimes, we use first names as verbs, nouns, or adjectives. How is this possible? Watch on, because in this lesson, I will teach you the other meanings of nine very common first names: Sue, Pat, Dick, Nick, Bill, Will, Don, Frank, and John. You will discover which one of these means “honest” and which one means “toilet”. Can you guess who is who? It may seem strange to you that some first names are used in different ways, but it is quite common in the English language, and you can use these words, too. Some of the meanings are formal and some are slang usages. Comment with a name in your native language that also means something else! https://www.engvid.com/english-vocabulary-using-names-as-nouns-verbs-adjectives

TRANSCRIPT

Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Ooo, look at the board. It seems E and Mini E are having a problem. Let's listen in. By the way, today's lesson is... It's about names that people have in English that are actually used as verbs, nouns, and adjectives; or they have a grammar function. And we're going to look at the board, see their conversation, and try to figure it out, and I'll explain the names to you. And by the way, you'll get to meet my family here, because a lot of my family names are on the board. Let's go to the board.

So, E says: "Let's be frank. You can't sue me." And Mini E says: "Yes I will. Don't dick me around!" Oo, that's a strong statement. And why I say it's in my family, because my family's names: I have an Auntie Susan, I have an Uncle Donald, my dad's name is Frank, my brother's name is Nicholas. Yeah, seems... Oh, and my grandfather's name was John. They're all here. Okay, anyway, let's go to the board.

So, let's start off at the beginning. Let's look at names. "Sue"... "Susan"... Short form of "Susan" is "Sue". Okay? And what "sue" means is to take someone to court. So, when you sue someone, you can take them to court for money or to get something back. But "to sue" means to go to court, to take... And make a legal argument that something belongs to you or should come back to you, or you want money; compensation for, and it's a verb.

Let's look at: "Pat"/"Patrick". "Patrick", the short form of "Patrick" is "Pat". And "to pat" somebody is like this, like you do with a dog. You know when you have a cat, and you're like: "Here, what a nice dog, what a nice cat"? And sometimes people do it to irritate you, they're like: "That was a really good job you did!" They pat you on the back, and you're like: "I'm not a dog. Don't pat me." Okay? But "a pat" is like that: "Good job. Good job. Good boy."

The next one is "Richard". Now, I don't know why this is, but the short form for "Richard" is "Dick". Okay? And "dick", if you watch... Well, if you like Batman-some of you do-the first Robin's name was Dick Grayson. His real name was Richard Grayson, and the short name was Dick Grayson. And when we say: "to dick", it means to play around; not to be serious, to act like an amateur or in a childish way. So, if you're dicking around at work, it means you're not doing your job. And if you're dicking around, you're playing. I'd say: "Stop dicking around." It means: "Stop fooling around. Stop playing around."

"Nick". "Nick" means to make a small cut. You go: "What is 'small cut'?" Well, you can do a small cut two ways. I'm going to give you my favourite example, which is the rose. When you have a rose, it has what's called a 'thorn'. When you put your finger here, you get cut. You get a small cut, which is a nick. But also when you shave, you know, when you've got your little shaver, and you get a little cut, you nick yourself. So, "a nick" is a small cut or a scratch. All right?

"Bill, B-B-B-B-B-Bill". Well, "Bill" can be either "Bill" or "Will". Okay? And I should have said, in this case, it's a verb, so we're looking here. So, "William", you can make it either "Bill" or "Will". Once again, "Will" makes sense; I don't know why "Bill". Maybe because if you take the "B"... I have no idea. I'm just making this up; it's not real. But if you take the "B" here and you make it like that, maybe. I don't know; I didn't make it up. But "bill", in one case, is to give a paper asking for money. So, when somebody says: "Bill me", it means: "Send me the amount... A paper with the amount that I should give to you." Maybe I had dinner and I bought some things, so you're going to send the bill with a dinner, the book, the coffee, and it will say how much money I must give to you. So, people say: "Bill me for this."

In fact, many of you get bills when you're billed by your cell phone company. They bill you, right? At the end of the month, they say: "You've done this, this, this, and this. Please pay this much money." That's a bill; you've been billed. "Will"... Well, you've studied grammar, I'm sure. It's a modal verb for intention or future, so: "I will go" or "I will do it"-my intent […]</media:description>

<media:description>In this lesson, we will talk about drinking and getting drunk. Do you drink “like a fish”? Maybe you are “hammered” or just “buzzed”. Treat your hangover with a dose of English slang and expressions that are sure to get your cheer on! I will teach you common expressions like “take the edge off”, “drunk as a skunk”, “wasted”, “pass out”, “tipsy”, and more. You have probably heard many of these in movies, shows, and in everyday life if you live in an English-speaking country. Watch the lesson to learn how to talk about everything alcohol-related, and don’t forget to do the quiz afterwards at https://www.engvid.com/learn-real-english-get-drunk-with-james/ . Remember to drink responsibly. Bottoms up!

TRANSCRIPT

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. I need a drink to take the edge off. Hey, E, how you doing? Seems E is ready to start drinking and wants me to join him. Today's lesson is on drinking. Not... I mean, I did a video on drinking before. Take a sip. This is what happens when people drink too much, past the social stage. Okay? So let's go to the board and take a look. And before I get started, this video is for Elle Williams (Chicklet). She'll know why when I get to "paralytic", and the rest of you will learn a brand new word you'll like a lot.

Anyway, so E's saying: "Cheers, mate", so he wants to invite me to a drink. Before I get started on the lesson, I want to kind of do a public service announcement (PSA): "Drinking can be a social activity, but too much is irresponsible. Please drink responsibly." Now I've done my PSA. Okay? So, I'm not advocating drinking too much, but this video is about drinking too much. Let's just face it, what it is. I mean, we're not going to be drinking Perrier, here. Okay?

So, you like to drink, you like to party. In some countries I know it's not legal, but if you're coming to a lot of Western countries, you can drink and some people take that to the extreme. And I'm going to go and go through the stages, actually, of drinking and where we start off with.

Now, if you have a drink, it probably won't affect you. In fact, for the average person, male or female, one drink every two hours will not really affect your system; it will be in your system, but won't affect you - how you think, cognitively how you think or you physically, your reflexes, depending on weight and everything else before people say: "But James, if it's a small woman..." Just generally speaking, okay?

Now, if you are going to go out drinking, I may suggest that you get a "designated driver". In North America, that is a person who is not supposed to drink, so if five people are going out, one of those people will not drink; they will have Coke or water all night and drive the other ones home. Okay? So get one of those. Because if you get stopped by the police or any law enforcement agent, if you have... I believe it's 0.06 or 0.08 - I can't recall what it is... It doesn't matter, but it's about a certain blood level, you will be considered under the influence and you could be in trouble, serious trouble for drinking and driving. Okay? This also goes for marijuana, but in this case, drinking and driving, being under the influence is illegal in most Western countries. Okay?

So, now that we've got the business out of the way, let's partay, okay? So, the first stage of drinking, you can see my cup is up. I'm with E. We're having a drink. "Cheers, mate", smashing glasses - a great time. And I want to have a drink. I'm after work; I've had a very busy day, and I'm like: "Oh, man, I had a lot of reports to do. I just need a drink to take the edge off." That means I want a drink, maybe two, but I'm not trying to get drunk. I'm stressed out; I want to relax. The edge - it's when you're... Here's the edge: You're here, and you're about to fall off. You're just there, you go: "I need to take off the edge. I want to relax, so I can take some steps back and relax." Okay? So, hey, the first stage of drinking, you want to take the edge off - you need to relax from a stressful day.

Now, "tipsy" is a little different. Once you get a little tipsy, we like to say you're slightly drunk, a little bit. Maybe you've had three drinks, and now you're kind of happy. You know? You just got that kind of walk on, like: "Hey, how ya doin'? I'm pretty good myself." You've got rid of the stress, and now you're happy-guy; like: "Yeah, I'm pretty good. How you doin'?"

Next one is "buzzed". You know "bee"? "Buzzzz". When you're buzzed, man, you're just kind of: "Yeah, I'm feeling good now." You've gone past the one, two social to: "I'm just going to let my brain go off for a little while", but you're not falling down drunk. You're either... You're more... A little bit more than happy, you're kind of a little bit out of it, but not too much. Once again, at any of these stages you shouldn't be driving. Have a designated driver because you're now under the influence of alcohol, and that's what that means […]</media:description>

<media:description>By learning about the important “ng” sound in English and practicing it, you will begin to sound more like a native speaker. The “ng” sound in English is one of three nasal consonant sounds. This means that it is pronounced by making sound through the nasal passage. In this video, I will teach you how to pronounce the “ng” sound, and I will explain how it differs from the “in” sound. You will learn the difference in sound between words that end in “-ing” and words that end in “-in”. For example, the words “doing” and “do in” mean completely different things. Watch the video to find out how to pronounce these words properly and sound more like a native English speaker. Next, take the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/how-to-pronounce-ng-in-english/

TRANSCRIPT

I've been working in a coal mine. Every day I've been working in the coal mine; I'm working over time. Work... Hi. James from engVid. Now, did I say: "I was working in a coal mine" or "I work in a coal mine"? Some of you are going to go: "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got it." and others go: "What?" That's today's lesson. The "ng" sound in English is often confused with "in", but let's go to the board and ask Mr. E.

So, Mr. E, was it...? Is it... Or is it "ing" or... "in"? "ng" or "in"? He doesn't know either. But before I continue, Aris from Mexico was a good student of mine. She made a couple mistakes, and I said: I promise I will make a video to clear this up. So, Aris, I hope it's a good video; you and your cute dimples and glasses.

All right, so is it "ing"...? So, not "ing", but "ng", because we can have "tongue", or "ing", but the sound, here, is... I'll show you how it's made in a second, too, but it's often confused with "in" for a lot of students. So, "ng", "ng", as in: "walking"... Okay? It's often confused with "walk in". "I walk in the rain because I like it, and I'm walking in the rain." Okay? It's very, very similar.

One of the things we want to know to say the difference... Because, to be honest, I'm not going to teach you about "in". I'll do another video with "n", "m", and "ing" or "ing", and we'll... We can compare, there, but today what I want to do is teach you about the "ng" sound, because if I can teach you that, it will help you with the "in" sound. It's my belief that if you get very good at one thing and can really see it, you can see everything that is not it. Okay? So it's the simplified way; instead of teaching you five different things. Just like: This is it, and if it's not that, it's different. And you should be able to pick it right up. Okay?

So, "ng" is one of the three nasal consonants in English. The three of them are-remember I said I'd do a video on it?-"n", "m", and "ng". There's "mm", "nn", and "ung". So, what that means is it vibrates through the nasal... Nose and nasal passage. And you're probably saying: "What? Nasal passage." Well, your nose. It comes from your nose over here. What happens is we move our tongue in a certain way, and the tongue in our head, and when we lift it up it kind of blocks the air so the air goes through your nose a bit. And when you do it, you'll feel like: "mmm", vibrate. "Mmm", vibrate. "Ng", you can touch your nose and you'll feel there's a vibration. That's because the air is going by where your nose is, and it makes that particular or interesting sound. Okay?

So, what's important to know about the "ng" sound is you can find this sound in the middle of words. For example: "anger" and "English". We're learning English. Ah, you knew I had to put it somewhere. Okay? So: "anger" and "English". Or you can find it at the end of the words, like: "thing" and "wrong". There are a lot of words in English that people confuse, like: "think" and "thing". I'm going to teach you today and you won't make that mistake. In fact, I'm going to teach you another lesson how to do that as well. So, this is a really good lesson because it will help you with many things. Okay?

So, as I was saying, people often confuse the "ng" with "in". Okay? An example is they confuse: "sleeping" with "sleep in", and "doing" with "do in". Well, what's the difference? It's not much? Well, they're very different. "Sleeping"-[snores]-the activity you do at night. "To sleep in" means to get up late. So, they're not even the same. They sound similar and they are related, but this is sleeping at night and sleep in. "Doing" is your activity now, and "do in five minutes", "do in time", so I'm talking about maybe a time period. "I can do it in five minutes." Now, what am I doing? Well, no, I can do this for you. I'll do it in five minutes; not now, but a little later. Similar; not the same.

So, I talked about this "ng" and showed you the two of them, but... And I did promise you that we would... I would make it that you could learn the one sound to see the difference. So, why don't I show you how to do it? Ta-da: How to do it. First, drop the jaw. Drop, drop, drop. […]</media:description>

<media:description>An idiom is an expression whose meaning is not predictable just by looking at its words. In this lesson, I will teach you several idioms that have something in common: they all contain the word “all”. You will learn the meaning of expressions like, “I’m all ears”, “It’s all in your head”, “all shook up”, “All hell broke loose”, “know-it-all”, “pull an all-nighter”, “all in a day’s work”, “not all there”, “for all I know”, and many more. You might recognize some of these from movies or shows, as they are very common expressions used frequently by native English speakers. These will be especially useful in casual conversation with friends and family. Take the quiz on this lesson at https://www.engvid.com/15-english-expressions-idioms-all/

TRANSCRIPT

So, E, I'm going to read this passage to you and... "I'm all ears"? Hi. James from engVid. Today I'm going to use "all" in phrases and idioms, and teach you how you can use them in common speech. And I'm going to try and put them into sections that you will find most useful to help you remember. E writes... Is saying right now: "He's all ears", and I bet you want to know what that means. I'll explain that to you, and I have another seven other idioms. Let's go to the board.

So, E's all ears. Before we even start, let's talk about: What is "all"? What does it mean? Well, generally, it means as much as possible, or it can mean complete or whole. The whole thing; all thing; complete. Excuse me. Or the parts of it. Now, we understand that, what does an "idiom" mean? An "idiom" is basically... It could be a phrase or a clause, but it's a bunch of words that are together that when you hear them, they don't actually make sense by themselves; but if you have the history behind it, you get it.

One of my favourite ones to tell people is: "It's raining cats and dogs." Clearly, dogs and cats don't fall from the sky, so you have to say: "What does that mean?" Well, it means it's a lot of rain. Okay? So, there's a lot of rain coming down. Now, it has an ancient... Not ancient roots. From, like 1600/1700s that there would be so much water coming down that dogs and cats might, like, float away or, you know, be swimming down the streets, so that's: "It's raining cats and dogs."

What does that have to do with what we're doing now? Well, today, we want to look at "all" and how "all" can be used in different idioms to have different meanings. You probably won't know what they mean right away; but by the time I'm done, it shouldn't be a problem.

So, let's look at the number one, the first one: I want to talk about emotional states. So, it's a mental state or an emotional state; how you think or feel. So, number one is: "It's all in your head." That means imaginary; it's not real. If something's all in your head, you go: "Oh, I think I have, like", I don't know. I... I don't want to say it because I don't want to give myself a disease. People might say: "Oh, I think I'm growing four heads." It's like: "It's all in your head. It's your imagination. It's not real. It's not happening. It's not going to happen." Okay? Or: "I think... Oh, I think Beyonc� is going to leave her husband and meet me, because she was on a TV program and she winked twice. That was her code that she wants me." It's in my head; it's not going to happen. Okay? Your friends will say: "You're crazy. It's not happening."

What's another one? We'll go down to number two. Oh, sorry. Before we go here, we'll go here: "All shook up". Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm all shook up. Those of you who like Elvis, that's an Elvis song: "All Shook Up". What does "all shook up" mean? Well, it's to shake... "Shake" means to... To disturb something. In this case, to make it extremely excited. You could be extremely excited if you win the lottery. If I won 20 million dollars, I'd be all shook up, I'd be like: "What am I going to do? I... I... I... How...? How do I get...?" I'm excited. I can also be very worried or disturbed when I'm all shook up. If you get very bad news... My baseball team, the Boston Red Sox, they lost again - I'm all shook up; I'm emotionally disturbed. Okay? And you can be worried as well.

So that's emotional state with "all". "All in your head". Remember we said completely? It's completely in your head. "You're all shook up", it means as much as possible you've been disturbed.

Let's look to the other ones. So, we talked about mental state, your emotional state; let's look at knowledge - how much you can know. All right? So, if "somebody's not all there", you're not all there, it means it's not working properly. Imagine if you had a car with four wheels, but only three tires. They're not all there; something's missing. You need one more tire to make four tires, four wheels. Makes sense. When somebody's not all there, something's wrong in the cabeza. In the head, there's something missing. Maybe half a brain. You know? You got to be careful. […]</media:description>

<media:description>DON’T MAKE THIS MISTAKE! Using the apostrophe incorrectly is a mistake that even native English speakers make frequently, but you shouldn’t make it. Should you write “my parent’s house” or “my parents’ house”? Is it “Barb and Bill’s house” or “Barb’s and Bill’s house”? It is time to clear this up and learn the possessive form once and for all! In this lesson, I will teach you where to place the apostrophe with an S when using the possessive form. First, we will look at the single possessive form, as in “Sue’s book”. Then, we will move on to the plural form. Also, we will clarify the two compound plural forms depending on context: “John’s and Lisa’s” or “John and Lisa’s”. Lastly, I’ll list the possessive forms that don’t use any apostrophe at all. This is an essential lesson that everyone needs to watch, even if you are an advanced English speaker. Be sure to do the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/apostrophe-how-to-show-possession/ after watching so you can solidify what you’ve learned. Never get caught misusing the apostrophe ever again!

TRANSCRIPT

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Hey, E. I think these are Mr. E's socks or his sock. E, is this yours? Hi. James from engVid. Today I'm going to do a lesson on the apostrophe, specifically about possession. And actually, this sock is mine and I want to thank Giovana, Nathanial, J2 (Joal), and Izis from Brazil because I taught them, and they bought me these beautiful socks. So, give me a second; let me put them on. [Whistles]

Speaking of belonging, I want to go to the board and I want to do... We'll explain a couple of ways we use the apostrophe to show possession in three different cases. Okay? So, the apostrophe is used for many things. Contractions - when we say: "don't" or "can't". Okay, you know that one. But this lesson is specifically about possession.

If we look at single possession, that means one person owns something, we actually have the thing, the noun (in this case, John), and we add the apostrophe plus "s". This doesn't make it plural. It means, in this case: "John's hat is red." The hat belongs to John. So, by adding this apostrophe "s" it tells us: Not plural, but it does belong to John. Simple enough, right? Add an apostrophe "s", you know it's belonging. This is James' book, and this is actually a really good one because some people will say you can't say: "James'" or "Charles'". If you go to England, you can. Check it out; we have another lesson on that, so do so. But the apostrophe "s" means it belongs to a singular person. Okay? So, when I said: "Mr. E's sock".

Next one, let's talk about plurals with "s". Well, okay, we understand what a single thing is with "s", right? But what happens if we have something like a plural, we have two boys and they have red hats, how do we discuss that? Well, simple. Because "boys" has an "s" already, we don't need to add another apostrophe "s". We simply put the apostrophe after the "s". That indicates to us that you can imagine... There's an imaginary "s", if I could. There's an imaginary "s" that goes here, but it's not necessary because we know it's already plural here and it's belongs to. So: "The boys' hats are blue." There are two boys and the hats belong to the boys, so: "The boys' hats are blue." Cool? All right.

Let's move on to the next one, and what I want to talk about here is compound plurals. Now, you might be saying: "What's a compound plural?" Well, in this case, we're taking two objects and putting them together. And maybe these two objects share the same thing and maybe they don't, and we can show the difference by how we use our apostrophes.

Now, in this case, we're going to look at, well, Bill and Hillary. Okay? Bill and Hillary have a house together. So, if you want to talk about both of them and you don't want to say: "Bill's house is nice. Hillary's house is nice", you can actually say... One and one is the same, if it's the same: "Bill and Hillary's", okay? So: "Bill and Hillary's house is nice." In this case, we're saying these are compounded, this is a conjunction, they're together, that's why it's compound. It's a compound noun; they go together. We put the apostrophe "s" to say it's one unit... Okay? Because it's a compound. And because of that, this one unit has a nice house. Cool? All right.

I know, you're smart and you're going: "But James, what if what they have is different; they don't share the same thing?" I'm glad you asked this, grasshopper, because what we're going to look at is an opinion. Opinion, like shoes or socks, can be different. And I'm going to show you that example here, because in this case, we do have a compound. These two things are together, but they are different; they don't share the same thing. In this case, we can see that Barbara is saying: "No", while George is saying: "Yes". We can't say they have the same opinion; we have to say it differently. […]</media:description>

<media:description>Phrasal verbs are often used in English to talk about social interactions. In today’s lesson, we are going to look at ways to talk about social situations when people get together with others for different reasons. You will learn to talk about how your meetings are going and express what kind of plans you have. I will teach you phrasal verbs such as “ask someone over”, “ask someone out”, “drop in”, “pop in”, “come over”, “drop off”, “hook up”, “bump into”, and more. I will particularly look at the prepositions that affect the verb and change its meaning. Also, you will find out how to tell when plans are casual or romantic. Lastly, I will teach you how to simplify your sentences by using these phrasal verbs. We will practice together, and then there will be a quiz for you to complete after watching at https://www.engvid.com/friendly-social-phrasal-verbs-in-english/

TRANSCRIPT

To-to-to-to. Huh? Hi. Shh. James from engVid. I'm going to do a video on phrasal verbs and going out, but I'm just listening to E's conversation. Hold on. "Yeah. Let's not ask James over tonight." What? E! Ahem. Excuse me for a second, guys. What do you mean: Don't ask James over? Why aren't you going to invite me?

In English, we use a lot of phrasal verbs to talk about interactions; social interactions, when we get together and what we do. Today's lesson I'm going to take some phrasal verbs and I'm going to show you how we use the prepositions to affect the verb to talk about how our meetings are going; whether our plans fell through, whether I'm going to ask you out, or we hook up. So you'll know the difference and you'll be able to understand them in context. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

Traitor. So, E doesn't want to ask me over. Okay? So, we're going to get there and find out what he means by that, but let's first take a look. I put: "Cheers" because a lot of these idioms have to do with social interaction and how we meet or don't meet. So, let's start with the first one, and I'm going to start over here: "out". Well, when you ask somebody out, it's to invite them to go out and do something. Seems obvious, yes? But when we ask someone out, usually it's a member of the opposite sex. So, as a man, I will ask a woman out for a date. So you might go: "Hey. I was wondering, Laurie, could I ask you out for dinner tonight?" Now, you wouldn't say that to just a friend, because you'd say: "Hey. Do you want to go out?" In this case, I'm asking you out so you can say yes or no. So: "Asking you out" means to get out of the house or go out, go outside somewhere; and specifically, we usually use it for romance, so keep that in mind. Right? Because when we're talking about "out", we're leaving something; we're going outside of a boundary.

Now, you see: "get out" and "go out", and you're probably going: "Duh. We know what that means - it's to leave." Actually, no. If I said to you: "I don't go out very often"... Remember I told you to go outside of a boundary? Well, "going out" in this case means I don't have any fun activities that I do. Yes, it does entail or it does involve-involve-leaving, but more... It's more going to do fun activities. So, if I said to you: "I need to go out more", I'm not saying just leave my house, but I want to do something; movies, dancing, singing, vacation. I need to get out. Right? Or I go: "You need to get out more." I don't mean just leave your house; it means: Go do something, get an ice cream, talk to friends, go to Starbucks - something. So, when we use "out" and either "ask out" or "get out", please remember that "ask out" is usually for a romantic involvement. So, if you're a man asking a woman or a woman asking a man in English, and you say: "I want to ask you out", they're going to think dating. Don't forget that. Okay? Now, "getting out" and "going out" means I need to get out and do some more fun activities. Good.

Now, if you're going to go out, you're probably going to get back in. Right? So, when we're coming back in, we're going to talk about "in" being involved in. Now, you're going to notice I have three words, here: "drop", "pop", "stop". Drop, pop, stop. And no, it's not dancing. I'm going to start with these ones and then I'm going to go back to this one; the top one, which might seem odd, but you're going to find in.

A "pop" is very quick. Right? You pop. Pop, it's gone. And when you stop, you stop. You kind of stop right now. When we say: "pop in" or "stop in", we talk about a short visit. So, I'm going to stop in for a second, and then I'm going to leave, or I'm going to pop in and then I'll leave. So don't expect me to stay for three or four hours. Maybe you invite me and you go: "Hey. Come over to my place. We'll have a drink." And I'll go: "Cool. I can only pop in for five minutes." It's going to be a short stay. Or: "I can only stop in for about 5-10 minutes; maybe an hour. I got to go to another dinner." So this is short. […]</media:description>

<media:description>Exceptions, exceptions, exceptions... AAAAH!!! Don’t you hate them? We have so many exceptions in English. In this lesson, I’ll talk about exceptions with comparatives and superlatives in English. A comparative word compares two things by adding an ‘-er’ ending. For example, we change ‘short’ to ‘shorter’ to make a comparative word. A superlative word is one whose quality, whether good or bad, surpasses all others. For example, we change “cute” to “cutest” to show that it is number one of its kind. As you can see, all you have to do to get the superlative is add ‘-est’ to the root word. But, my friends, this is English, and there are exceptions. That’s where this lesson comes in. I will teach you superlative and comparative words that are exceptions to the rule, like “worst”, “best”, “most”, “least”, “farthest”, “more”, “less”, “worse”, and “better”. These are common words that most people use every day, so it’s important to understand them and to say them correctly. Find out how much you know by taking the quiz: https://www.engvid.com/comparative-superlative-adjectives-exceptions/

TRANSCRIPT 

Hmm. The One, it's probably the best book I've read in a while. Hi. James from engVid. Today I want to talk to you about, funny enough, The One. And why I say: "The One" is usually when we talk about superlatives and comparatives, the number one comes up quite often. And, now, I'm not going to do your standard lesson on what the comparative is and the superlative is; you probably are aware of this, but I would like to point out five exceptions to the general rules. So, I'm going to quickly go over the difference between comparative and superlative, and then go into the exceptions. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

So, E, you got my five for me. Cool. You're going to notice on the board I have the number "1" written out repetitively. There's a reason for it, and we'll get into it. But let's start looking at: What is a "superlative"? I like to look at superlative as in Superman. Superman is the best, the strongest, the fastest, la, la, la - number one. So, when you think of a superlative, think of the highest or the best amount. Or, because it's extreme, it could be the worst. Now, I've used a couple of them already, but we're going to go to the board and get a little deeper into them. So, it could be number one at the top or number one at the bottom. Okay?

"Comparative" is when we look at two things and we want to say there's a difference between them. "He is bigger than she is" or "James is bigger than Mr. E" - comparing the two. So, with a comparative, you generally find that we add "er" to the end of the word to tell you that something is being compared to something else. Okay? Comparative, and you'll see "er": "bigger", "smaller", "smarter", "taller". Cool? We got that.

And with a superlative, we add usually "est". Right? And the "est" is for the "biggest", "strongest", "longest", "fastest", and it will be the number one in its category. And remember what I said: It could be the number one as in the best, like the best one position, or in the lowest position number one. Are you ready? So let's go to the board and find out what our exceptions are. You might be surprised, but they're actually quite often used, and actually quite often misunderstood.

So, the first one we're going to look at is the "best". If you're from Japan, it's "ichiban"; if you're from Mexico or not even Mexico, any Latino country, it's "numero uno" or we say "number one". That's what the best is. Kind of simple, right? And we know what "good" is, because what's the opposite of "good"? "Bad". "Good" is something we like. Now, why this is an exception is because usually, if you remember rightly, when I said "biggest", we start with "big" and we go to "biggest", and we go "bigger". So, we use the root word and we just add the "er" or the "est". But when we look over here, if you look at my chart, increasing-meaning it's getting better-there's an improvement going on - we start with the word "good". That has nothing to do with the word "best". Very different. And this is why it's an exception; it doesn't follow the rule of: Take the root word and add "er" or "est". It's a completely different word, but they are related in we say something starts off "good" - something you like, like 70%... 75% on a test is good. It's not great, but it's good, right? Or 80%.

"Better", and this is where we talk about the improvement; "er" means a comparative... A comparison, and we're looking at two different things and comparing them; while "good" is 75%, "better" than that is 90%. There's a difference between the two numbers; it's an improvement or an increase. But the "best" would be 100%. Right? See, if you get 100%, you can't get much better than 100%, and we say that's the "best". Now, these numbers aren't real. I'm not saying each number corresponds to these things, but what I'm trying to give you an idea is how they're related. […]</media:description>

<media:description>One o’clock, two o’clock, three o’clock, rock! In this lesson, we will look at 12 expressions that have to do with time, one for each hour of the clock. I will teach you commonly used expressions like “at the 11th hour”, “seven-year itch”, “third time’s the charm”, “around the clock”, “do time”, and more. This kind of lesson comes once in a blue moon. So after an eight-hour day, why not take five and watch this useful video? And just like clockwork, there will be a quiz after the video to help you practice what you’ve learned: https://www.engvid.com/12-expressions-of-time-in-english/

TRANSCRIPT

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Damn it! E, where's the lights? Oh, God. Oh: "Thank you Aputure. It was dark, you brought the light"? Oh, yeah. Before I get started, E's correct, we actually... We... Our lights weren't working and they went out, and I'm actually doing... I don't do this often. Okay? But I want to give a shout out to Aputure because they brought us lights. Let there be lights. Our lights were actually failing, and Aputure kindly... and this is really cool. They actually asked if they could help us out. They actually gave us... Yeah, they gave us some free lights. They said: "Would you like lights?"

Here's the funny thing, straight up: They didn't know we needed lights. Ours were starting to go. Maybe they were watching a video or something. They offered free lights to us, and we took them, and they've been working beautifully. So, in any of the videos you've seen and you liked with Ronnie, myself, or Jade, or anyone - these are the ones we're using.

Anyway, done with that because I'm not doing an infomercial for anybody. I'm a free man! But you got to give it out. So, and yeah, if any other company, if you... If you're ever interested in helping out, feel free to do so. Okay? So I'm not a pitch man, so I'm going to move on, but thanks Aputure. E, thank you.

Now, moving on because I want to talk about time. And I brought with the... Aputure with this particular video because in Canada we have what's called Daylight Savings Time, and the time shifts. And I want to give you some idioms on time, and you know, it's me, it's James, so I'm not going to give you just idioms; I have a plan.

So, in this case, we're going to go around the clock; and as we go around the clock, I'm going to give you an idiom for each hour. And what I mean by that is: Each hour has a number. Right? There's 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 - and I'm going to give you an idiom that will go with, like, the number 1, for instance, like: "Once in a lifetime." Right? Number 1, and then you have: "Once in a lifetime", so you remember: "Ah, it happens once." And let's go to the board. Are you ready? All right.

So, I'm going to start at... Where should I start? Where should I start? Number 1; first one: "Once in a blue moon". True fact: Blue moons happen every two to three years. A blue moon will happen every two to three years because it happens rarely; it's not very often. If you think about that, if it's every two to three years, that's every 40... 24 to 36 months - that is not very often that it happens. But in the year 2018, it's happening every two to three months; it's a rarity that almost never happens, so that's even bigger being rare. Yes, I researched it because I read. You should, too. All right? So we're... That's what's happening in 2018 in case you ever see this 20 years later, and go: "Liar! It's every two to three years." I told you it was rare; go check it out. So that means it rarely happens.

Hour number 2: "Two shakes of a lamb's tail." Maa-maa. This is an oldie, but a goodie. Old people who speak English will know what it is; some younger punks - yeah, you punks, you don't know what it means. A lamb has a little tail and it moves quickly. So... Maybe that's a goat. I think I'm doing a goat. I don't know. But it means very quickly because a lamb's tail is very quick, so it flicks very quickly. All right? So: "Two shakes of a lamb's tail" meaning I will do it quickly or it will be done quickly.

Ah, I forgot something here. I'm going to use my brown marker because that means I've done something bad. There's another word for "bad", it starts with "s", but I'm not going to go there.

Okay: "3rd time's the charm". "3rd time's the charm" means you've tried something one time, it didn't work; the second time it didn't work; but we're saying lucky number three - if you try it the third time, then it works. "Charm" means luck. If you're charmed, you've got luck. Okay? So: "A 3rd time the char-... 3rd time's the charm" is: The third time it will work. Cool?

So, we're at number 4. Yes, I know you can read; you're very smart individuals. Okay? You notice I put "40", okay? And they're going: "James, that's the number 4. There's no 40 on a clock. Not even in military time." I know. But when we speak in English, we don't say: "40", we usually say "4T". […]</media:description>

<media:description>The word “heart” is used for many expressions in English that are emotional in some way. For example, the expressions “cross my heart”, “have a change of heart”, “follow your heart”, “heart to heart”, “heart of gold”, “light-hearted”, “half-hearted”, and many more, are all used to describe a person or situation that is emotional. I will teach you these and many more common expressions that you can start using today. Native English speakers use them frequently, and I think they will be very useful to you, too, especially around Valentine’s Day! You’ll have a chance to practice by doing a quiz with me during the video, but don’t forget to do the main quiz on EngVid after watching the lesson: https://www.engvid.com/13-heart-expressions-in-english/ If you have your heart set on learning new expressions in English, your heart will skip a beat for this lesson all about heart expressions.

TRANSCRIPT

"She seduced him with some light-hearted banter." [Laughs] Huh? Are you trying to tell me something? Hi, guys. James. The heart - it's the thing that keeps us alive; it's in our chest, and in English, we use it to use it for a lot of expressions. And E, here, is helping us, showing us, you know, how we can have fun with it. And I'm going to have some fun teaching you this lesson, and you're going to have some fun learning some things; especially on this special holiday, Valentine's, where we celebrate love and the heart. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

So, here, E is saying the balloon is light; not heavy. So that's not serious. Another word for "heavy" is "serious". And "heart", it means with emotion, so this is a light emotion or a fun thing to talk about; fun conversation. Are you ready to have some fun? You'll learn... So, our little hearts will tell us which phrase we're talking about, and they all have to do with sort of an emotional quality; how the emotions come together.

And our big heart, we have a couple of them: "heart of gold", "half-hearted", "change of heart", "cross my heart", "follow your heart". I've expanded some of them out here, but let's go from here. "Heart of gold" is... Well, gold is precious, right? It's special. If you have a heart of gold, we usually say you're a very good person. "He has a heart of gold. They're nice". "Half-hearted" I'll come to in a letter... Later. "A change of heart", I'll do that as well.

But this one I like, here. These two I want to tell you about. You'll see people go: "Cross my heart", and it means: "I promise", because my heart... Remember what I said about heart? If you don't have a heart, you will die, so when I say: "Cross my heart", I mean, like: "I promise so much that I put my life on it. I cross my heart this is true." And: "Follow your heart". "Follow your heart" means: Do what you love. Seeing clearly is not something I'm good at or love, but you get the point. So, if you like playing soccer, play soccer. If you like to read, read. If you want to start a business, start a business. Follow your heart because, you know, it's the thing you love.

Right now I'm having a "heart to heart" with you. And what is "heart to heart"? A serious conversation. So, if you say to someone: "Okay"... You have a girlfriend: "Nancy, we have to have a heart to heart." She'll go: -"Baby, what about?" -"Your breath, it stinks." Okay? "Heart to heart", serious conversation. "By heart". Like my heart, it's always there for me. I don't need to think about it, I don't need to try to make it work; it's just there. When you know something by heart, it means you know something completely; you don't have to study it, you don't have to look at it. Like, if I'm reading this book: "She seduced him with some light-hearted banter", I'm reading. If I know it by heart, I will say: "She seduced him with some light-hearted banter. I do not need to look; I know it by heart." Okay? That means you don't need to study; you know it. No one should question you on it.

"Have your heart set on something". You really want it. It's, like, you see a shirt, and you think the shirt is amazing, and you really want to have this shirt. If you have your heart set on it, it will actually make you cry if you don't get it. Or a job, you really want a job and you go for that job, and you have your heart set on it - it means: I want this very, very strongly. Cool? All right.

Here's one. I like this one: "take heart". Watch romance movies, you'll see this. You're not going to see... Or if you see Batman from the 1960s, you'll say: "Take heart, bat-watchers. Batman will get out of it. We promise." It means: "Be encouraged. Have faith. Know that things will be good." So if you're a little girl and your father goes: "Take heart. Our dog will come back." You really shouldn't; he's gone for good, but if he says: "Take heart" - be encouraged, have faith the dog will come back. You can believe. Okay? "Take heart we will make America great again." I don't believe I said that. Forgive me, everybody, please. […]</media:description>

<media:description>One of the trickiest aspects of learning English is mastering homophones. Homophones are words that sound the same but are spelled differently. A classic example is “there”, “their”, and “they’re”. These three words are pronounced exactly the same way but mean completely different things. Even native English speakers often misspell homophones like “your” and “you’re”, “weather” and “whether”,  “then” and “than”, “to”, “too”, and “two”, and the list goes on. Once you know the difference between all of these, you will notice people’s mistakes everywhere. So don’t be that person. Learn homophones once and for all by watching this lesson, and practice by doing the quiz afterwards, at https://www.engvid.com/english-vocabulary-27-common-homophones/ 

Next, watch my lesson on the worst mistakes that native English speakers make: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ6SXCpasvI

TRANSCRIPT

[Whistles] Wow, what a good book. I should buy another one of these. What? Oh, hi. James from engVid. I was just looking at my book, here, and it seems E has a question. Let's go take a look. So, what's that, E? "I won the race?", "I one the race?" - you don't know the difference? Do you know the difference? Today we're going to work on homophones. I'm going to explain what they are and give you some very common examples that you've probably made mistakes with, but I'm going to help you today to clear them up. You ready? Let's go to the board.

Oh, I said "homophones", and I know there are some of you out there that are grammar nerds, and you're going to say: "Oh, homophones, homograms, dah, dah." I'm going to break it down and say: When we talk about "homo" it means the same; the same. And in this case, a "homograph" is something that is written graphic. It is written like a picture. And when we say "homophone", I'm sure you have a cellphone, like, you know, cellphone. We call it a "phone" because it's the sound. With a cellphone, we deal with sounds; and with homographs we deal with what is written.

Today I really want to concentrate more on homophones, which are words that are going to sound the same... So, let's take a look: Homophones are words that sound the same, but they are different. I forgot a period, here. And an example would be "bare" and "bear". Okay? Or: "whether" and "weather". And I've had many students ask me: What's the difference. They go: "How do you pronounce it? I... I know it looks the same or almost the same." And I say: "It sounds the same." They go: "Why? They mean vastly or very different things." I go: "Yes, you're right, and I'm going to help you see the difference." Now, the problem with a homophone, of course, is when you say it, you don't know how it's spelt, and we use the spelling to tell us that it's a different meaning. The secret to that is context, and I'll go through a couple of examples a little later on and show what I mean by: If you listen to the context, you will have an idea of what they mean.

As I said: homographs are words that are written the same, but have different meanings. But because I'm not going to go into homographs right now, I'm not going to give you the examples. I'm going to give you the examples for the homophones, here. And if you notice, I have something that looks like a calculator or, you know, some buttons you can press on a dial for a phone. And I did that because, in some of these, we can use the homophones to show or illustrate the difference.

So, let's do the first one, here. "One" and "won". If you noticed, E had a problem with: "I won the race?", "I one the race?" To be honest, once again, it's a homophone; the sound is exactly the same, but the context will tell us what the difference is. "One" is clearly number one. I have one friend - a number. But when I won a race, because it's a competition, I can go: "Oh, it's 'won'." That's our first homophone.

We did number one; let's look at number two. Because I'm smart like that, I did "two" and "to". In this case, "two", the number two - you know it? Right? One, two, three. We have another "to", this one, here, which can be used both in an infinitive form and a preposition. Examples. "I want to buy" is an infinitive form. "We're going to the store". Right? We can use that as a preposition "to"... "To" or "from", when we're using it like that.

And this one I like as well: "too", "t-o-o". I say this is what we call there's too many o's or it's excessive in English. Meaning that it's more than you want. An example is: "It's too... My coffee is too hot; I cannot drink it." Cool? All right. That's the number "two". Notice the homophone? They all sound the same. So, if you're going: "Well, why is he teaching us?" It's just so you know, when you see these words, do not change how you say them; the pronunciation is the same, but know when you're writing them or in the sentence you're saying them...

<media:description>Improve your vocabulary! There is more to time vocabulary than “when”, “while”, “after”, and “before”. In fact, there are words you can use to express more detail than just a moment in time. For example, when you say “nowadays”, it gives the listener a sense of change from past to present. In this lesson, I will teach you many useful time words and phrases, like “old-fashioned”, “lately”, “of late”, “outdated”, “latest”, “a week from now”, and more. These words are commonly used by native English speakers in everyday conversations to express more detail about a time period in the past, present, and future. After watching, your next step will be to do the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/time-vocabulary-phrases-in-english/ 

TRANSCRIPT

I've been lonely, so lonely I could die. Oh, sorry, that's Elvis. E's crying because he's been very lonely lately. He said very lonely lately. Very lonely... E, what do you mean: "You've been very lonely lately"?

Hi. James from engVid. A lot of times we, in English, use time... When I say time words, I'm not talking about: "when" or "while", or "after" and "before", which indicate what is happening in time; if it's coming this way or that way. But we have time words and time phrases, which is to give us more information than "before" or "after" because they can be used more generally.

Example: I can say: "Before I did this video, I had dinner." But if I say: "I recently had it", you know it's in memory; in the period of time in my memory that's very close. It's a little deeper, a little bit more knowledge or a little bit more information.

So, when we're looking here, I'm going to give you some phrases and some words that do the same thing as "recently" does, which is more information than "before" or "after". Cool? Let's go to the board, and we'll find out why E is so lonely he could die. [Laughs] Anyway.

Just as time flows, I'm going to start in the natural progression of time. Past happens before, then the present is now, and the future. And I'm going to try to give you a few words with each that you will find that native speakers use on a regular basis to give you an idea or an impression about what kind of time they're talking about. And some of these things-and E gave me a really good one with "this Wednesday" and "next Wednesday"-are so common that we use it that, you know, foreign speakers get confused, because they're like: "What do you mean there's only one way to say? Why be so specific?" It's like: No, we're actually giving you more information.

So, let's go to the board and we'll start out with "old-fashioned". This one's kind of easy, because we're talking about the past, here, because you know "old" is before. But you're going to say: "Old-fashioned, why?" Well, when somebody says something is old-fashioned, they usually mean it's not in style anymore. All right? It's not modern. So you can say: "This is an old-fashioned donut." It doesn't mean it's bad. It just means it's... You know, it's from an older style or a generation prior to. But when somebody says: "You have old-fashioned manners or old-fashioned language", they're saying: "You know what? People don't kind of use this anymore. That's an old-fashioned idea." Right? It's kind of not being used, so we have that to the past. It's usually associated with things in the past or things that are gone or should be gone.

"Out-dated". "That out-dated mode of thinking they use on a regular basis - PC talk (politically correct talk)." It means it's no longer used or no longer useful. So, you might have this idea or you might have, I don't know. My cellphone is like an S4 from Samsung. I'm mentioning it for two reasons. Samsung, I need a new cellphone; it's an S4. And you people out there, please give me a new cellphone. I'm joking. I want Samsung to give me a cellphone. Advertising for ya. But my phone's basically out-dated. It's so out-dated that they use it to... Oh, I don't even have a good joke - it's that out-dated. It's no longer used or useful. Most new systems are at an S8 or what have you, so somethings I can't use. I don't care. I like my phone, to be honest.

Now, "out-dated" means it's just kind of, like, not being used; no longer used or useful. Operative word or the word that's important is not... "Not useful" means it's not as convenient as something that would be new.

The word you don't want to hear someone say to you is "obsolete". All right? If this is obsolete, it is no longer used. Yes. Old credit cards. You know, you don't pay it? It becomes obsolete; you can't use it no more. Bad example. Obsolete - dinosaurs. Ever seen one? Mm-mm - you don't. Birds is as close as we got to them; they gone. They're obsolete. That technology or that biological technology is no longer used, people. We are the new ones.

Being the... So, now time to move to the present. What present...? Present day forms do we use to explain what's going on in the present? […]</media:description>

<media:description>I have put together a vocabulary lesson on five phrases of direction in English. I will teach you the meaning of “inside out”, “round and round”, “flip-flop”, “upside down”, and “tip top”. Phrases of direction are useful because they express the direction of moving objects, but can also express the way in which abstract ideas change. For example, a fish will “flip-flop” on the ground, and you may flip-flop on choosing a restaurant for dinner. This means it is difficult for you to decide. I am here to help you make sense of this topsy-turvy topic. Watch all the way to the end because there will be two bonus phrases for you to learn that will help you sound like a native English speaker.

Don't forget to take the quiz on this lesson at https://www.engvid.com/common-direction-phrases-in-english/

After that, watch my lesson on common DOWN phrasal verbs:

TRANSCRIPT

I'm having a hard time reading this book, E. It's all upside down. Oh, you're having the same problem. Hi. James from engVid. E and I are having a problem because he's looking at himself in the mirror, and his head is in the wrong place. His head should be here, but it's on the bottom. And I'm reading this book and I don't understand the words, because the words are in the wrong place; they're all upside down. You know what? That's probably one of the phrases that we use in English that confuses many people who are learning the language, because the words are all, well, kind of topsy-turvy. You know? Don't make sense.

Today's lesson, I'm going to show you five common things that we say, and they are direction related, which they do give us an idea of what direction things are going in, except we often say it without thinking that you won't understand because we use them only in this manner, in a certain way. Let's go to the board and take a look.

E's having problems because his picture or his mirror is upside down. My book was upside down. What does that mean, exactly? Let's start with the first thing. I've got one "inside-out". Here's my shirt. I was going to wear it, but you can see it. This is the right way to wear the shirt. When it's inside-out, you will notice... There we go. Now it's the wrong way because you can see the label. Have you ever worn your shirt inside-out by accident, and someone has to go: "Ahem. Your shirt's inside-out"? You're like: "Oh god! It is! It's terrible! I never thought about it!" it means the in part is on the outside.

Funny enough, this is usually when people wear their clothes incorrectly, but we have another way of using it. When you say: "I know something inside-out", it means: I know everything about it because I know every small part, from the inner part - the smallest part to the bigger part. So, I say: "I know this book inside-out." I know everything about this book. So, listen for context, because if they: "Hey, son. Your underwear is inside-out", it doesn't mean: You know everything about underwear; it means you should take it off and put it on properly. Okay? But if you know a book inside-out... You see this? This is the outside of the book; this is the inside of the book. So, when saying: "I know this book inside-out", it means I know all of the information on the inside, right to the outside. Cool, huh? One thing and you've learned two things. Let's see what else we can learn. So, listen for that when English people speak. They go... If they say to you: "I know everything about this company inside-out; I know everything about this company, from the floor, who cleans it, how they make the money - I know everything." But if my shirt is inside-out, I need to go home and change. I like that one.

Let's look at number two. Round and round you're calling me, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Dah-dah-dah-dah. Dah-dah-dah... Yeah, it's an old song. Yup. Anyway, that's a song. "Round and round", it means to go in a circle, moving in a circle. If you say: "We've had this conversation for, like, 20 minutes, and we're just going round and round the same things", it means the conversation isn't getting any... Nothing new is coming; we're just talking about the same things again, and again, and again. Like a CD. Hopefully you know what a CD is, because everyone streams now. Or a DVD, it goes around and around. So, a lot of times, in English, people go: "We've been through this before; we just go round and round the same conversation." It means: Nothing is new; we just move in a circle, like my poor dogs who are confused and going in different directions. And they're like: "Round and round. No, that's not round; it's the..." Yeah. You got it. Okay.

Number two. So, things, when you hear a Canadian or a Canadian English person... English speaker go: "Why are we going around and around the same thing?" They should say "round in a circle". They won't say "circle", usually; they'll just say "round". […]</media:description>

<media:description>Apostrophes are used for many purposes in English writing. Today, I will talk about two ways we use apostrophes to show missing letters: for informal speech and for writing accepted contractions. English is confusing enough when we can read all the letters! When letters are removed and replaced with apostrophes, how do you know how to say these words? I’ll teach you how to pronounce common contractions so there’s no confusion, and then we’ll practice together with some example sentences.

TRANSCRIPT

Hmm. A license to print money. [Laughs] I wish. Hey, E. How ya doin'? Hi. James from engVid. I was reading an interesting book on making money, but I noticed E's up to something. He's praying... He's playing detective, as you can see - Sherlock E. And I want to know: What's he up to? And he says: "How you doin'?" And I noticed that he's looking at this strange thing, it's called an "apostrophe". Why don't we find out what he's doing, and what is the case of the missing letters? And before I even go there, I would like to say: Thank you to Francisco from Paraguay-yay!-for this brilliant shirt. Thank you. And Paraguay, thank you for watching. Okay?

Anyway, let's go to the case for the missing letters. We're going to talk about apostrophes. Now, apostrophes are part of our... Well, we have... Sorry. Periods, question marks, exclamation marks - these are all markings we put in our language to tell us that something is interesting about that sentence or something is missing in the sentence. In this particular case, we're talking about the apostrophe. There are a couple of other things it's used for, but right now I wanted to talk about missing letters. You know? Like: "Has anybody seen my letter? My letter 'g' - it's missing since this morning at 9am." You go: "What are you talking about?"

Well, let's start here. Missing letters. Sometimes at the end of a present continuous verb... And, you know, verbs are: "run", "do", "go", "stop". Okay? And the continuous form would be: "running", "doing", "going", "stopping". Okay? The letter "g" is dropped. Now, this isn't necessarily in writing; it's in spoken English, so I want to make sure you understand that. You may see it in, you know, like songs' lyrics or modern works of literature, you know, or in conversation when they're writing, you know, paragraphs, like: "What are you doin', Johnny?" But it's not supposed to be written in formal language.

So, if you're doing an essay or a government document, please do not use these forms that I'm about to teach you. Okay? Understand them when you read them and when someone is speaking, and you can understand why they're saying: "What are you doin'?" instead of "doing". That it's the same word, same meaning, but just a different pronunciation. Okay? And this is what we said here, right? The "g" is dropped, causing a change in the pronunciation. The meaning of the verb, however, stays the same. I can say: "How are you doing?" and "How you doin'?" Same word, same meaning, different pronunciation. Just... We call it colloquial usage.

Here are some examples. "Are you goin' to the party? Are you going to the party? Are you goin' to the party?" Okay? There you go. The dropping the "g" is shown by the apostrophe. And sometimes when you read a comic book, or a book, or a novel, you know, a romance novel, and they're saying: "He's goin' to help us." That's what this is. So you don't have to go: "What is this new word in English I've never seen before?"

"What is she sayin'? What is she sayin'?" Instead of: "What is she saying? What is she saying?" where our tongue drops to the bottom of our mouth. "What is she saying? Saying", tongue down here. "Sayin'", tongue goes to the top of the mouth. "n" sound is at the top; "ing" sound is at the bottom.

"He is doin' it for you." Sorry. "He is doin' it now for you. He is doin' it". I have a hard time saying these things. Okay? This is... So, it's not in my language. It's not in my vernacular. Not in my vocabulary, so for me to say it, I actually have to think about it. So I really do when you understand when you have a problem with it. Okay? So: "He is doin' it now for you."

And to be honest, this is not even right. This is an incorrect sentence. Nobody who would say this would say "for you". He would say: "He is doin' now for ya. He's doin' it now for ya, and that's how it's going to go." So, if you don't like it, I'm like: I'm sorry, but this is how you would normally speak with that. This kind of contraction will lead to this kind of English, and "ya" means "you", and that's why I have a hard time saying it… […]</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

So, we got to hold on to what we got. It doesn't make a difference if we... E, what are you doing? Want to fill me in? Oh, thanks: Today's lesson. Hi. James from engVid. Today's lesson is on "fill", a common verb that we use in English and has many different meanings when we put it with prepositions. In other words, this lesson that I'm going to fill you in on is on phrasal verbs with "fill". Okay? I'm going to use three prepositions to show you the different ways we use it, and give you, you know, the bonus and that a little bit later on. Let's go to the board.

So: "Fill in the blank" is the first one. Some of you, if you've been to English-speaking countries, have heard this before; maybe not. But let's look: What does the word "fill" mean? First of all, it's a verb, and it means to put somebody or something in a space, a situation, or a container so it is completely or almost completely full. So, an example is: If you were to have a cup of coffee and you said: "Fill it up", they would take the coffee from here and put it in this space or container, and make it go up. Okay? Cool. Let's go to the board and see what else we can do.

I'm going to start with "up". "Up" is a direction, and it means to increase. Right? So when someone, for instance, says: "Fill up"-in this case: "Fill up my car"-it means make it completely full. If you are going on a long journey or destination and you are taking your car with you, you might want to fill up the gas. In this case, make it full. Right? Now, "fill up" also could be for food. "I don't want to fill up on French fries before I get my salad", that means be completely full. Right? "I'm going to fill up my schedule for next week", make it completely full.

Now, another one with "up" is to "fill up on". It means to have as much of something, as much of something as possible. The example I gave you with French fries: "I need to fill up on fruits today; I didn't have enough yesterday." That means to have one thing and be completely full of it. Cool? All right. So, we could say: "We need to fill up on groceries before we go on vacation", completely, right? Get as much as possible of this thing.

The next one we'll do is "out": "fill out". "Fill out" can be complete the needed information. When you go to the government and you have to do a form, and they say: "Please fill this out", they will give you a piece of paper and there will be places where you might have to put your name, your address, and all sorts of information that they require in order to help you. So: "Fill that out, please." When you go to the doctors the first time, usually they say: "Please fill out this form", and you put down all of your information. So, "to fill out" means to completely put in... Complete needed information for a form or paper. Okay?

Another one for "fill out" is this: To grow or get larger. When you're young, say you're a young boy, you're usually very small. And when you become a man, we say you fill out; you get your muscles, you get bigger, and you get stronger. Also, when you go to the gym, sometimes you need... You will fill out. You will go to the gym for one month, two months, three months - nothing happens. And then one day, people will say: "You filled out. Look at your big, wonderful muscles." They've gotten bigger. Cool? So, in this case: Complete the form; and this one: To grow larger - we grow. Cool?

Third one. "Fill in". Now, you will notice that "fill in" and "fill out" are similar for the first ones; complete needed information and complete needed information. In this case, when someone says: "Please fill in the form" they usually are referring to the blanks, the empty spaces; while in "fill out", they mean the whole form. Think of "larger", they want the big thing completed; while in "fill in", they're saying: "Fill in each blank." All right?

Next: "fill someone in". To fill someone in is to give them information. Let's say Mr. E went to a meeting. […]</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Man, I really have to read this book and I just don't have the time. Hi. James from engVid. If you're like me, you have to read a lot of material. If you are studying English or you're learning English, you probably don't like to read, which is too bad, because reading is one of the fastest ways to improve... Well, let's go to the board and find out.

As you can see, E is running very quickly, here. Right? And he's trying to read. So, we're going to learn to read faster today, and I'm going to teach you how to read faster with two different techniques, and I'm going to teach you... You'll start to enjoy your reading. So we'll go to the board and we'll talk about reading, why it's important, and what we can do about it.

The first thing I want to talk about with reading: Reading helps to do a couple of things. Number one, it helps you to learn new things. When you read a book about philosophy, it teaches you about somebody's new idea or a new invention. It gives you new vocabulary. Many words... In fact, they say if you don't understand 90% of the material, you won't understand it; but even just reading something, if you have a dictionary, will help you go and learn new vocabulary to understand material, so it gives you new words; it gives you a better or a wider way to speak.

It helps you to understand. Sometimes when someone says something it's a little too fast, but then when you read it, you have time to read it, go back, read it, go back, read it, and go: "I got it." Right? It gives you time to look at the picture; the mental picture or the written picture. It gives you new ideas. Remember you learn new things? Well, when you start adding idea from this book, idea from that book, you get new ideas of your own; you become more creative. Your world becomes a richer place to live.

And, finally, because we're doing English, you learn how to speak a language. Like: "Stop. What do you mean? How do I learn to speak by reading?" Well, for you people who are learning to speak a language-okay?-reading shows you the structure that people use when they speak. Reading shows you new vocabulary, or it shows you what we call the colloquial; the common person's way of speaking. You get all that from reading; how to say it, where to put the verb and the noun or the adjective. Right? Cool? That's what it can do, and that's what's important to us. Our reading is going to teach us how to speak, but also it's good to be able to read in a country, because I often say: If you cannot read in a language, you're stupid. And if you wonder what I mean, think about the guy who when you give a simple sentence, like: "The cat went in the house", cannot read it and he reads it like: "The cat went in", you go: "The guy's stupid." Don't be stupid. Don't be stupid in your language; don't be stupid in my language. So today we're going to work on a process to help you with reading.

Now, as much as I said all these great things about reading, there are a couple of things to be aware of, or... Actually, I don't have to tell you. You know, but I want you to know that I understand, so I'm putting it on the board so you know what I'm going to teach you will help you overcome or help you solve that problem. Problem: Reading takes a long time. Well, in your own language it takes some time, but if you're learning another language, it will always take you much longer to read because you have a problem of translating, or skipping back and translating. Translating, you know what I mean; you translate from the language you're looking at into your own language to understand it, and then translate it back to that language - that's a lot of work. And if you think about how long that takes, that's like two different trips, like: In, out; in, out; in, out for every word. That will take... Something that takes four minutes to read - make you read it for 20 minutes. And who wants to read one paragraph or five sentences, and it takes 10 minutes, and you still don't understand it? That's a problem.

Another problem: You don't remember what you read. Do you remember when I said to you: "You're reading up and down"? […]</media:description>

<media:description>Whether you are talking about the different styles of music you like or the kinds of foods you can and cannot eat, you frequently talk about categories, sometimes without realizing it. In this lesson, I will teach you phrases that you can use to describe categories of things that are important to you. This will help you discuss differences or things you have in common with others. For example, you could talk about a "type" of movie, a "style" of clothing, a "sort" of person, etc. Native English speakers often use shorter forms of these words, and I will teach you how to use this slang, as well. Take the quiz on this lesson at https://www.engvid.com/english-vocabulary-kind-of-sort-of/ .

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from engVid. This is my style of magazine; it gives me a lot of information, and the type of information I get from it is sort of cool. Now, I've used three terms or phrases: "sort of", "kind of", "style of" that you may not be familiar with; or if you are familiar, you don't truly understand. My job today is to tell you the difference between the individual words: "kind", "sort", "style", and "type"; what it means when you put "of"; what the slang meaning "of"; and how you can use it. I have a complicated drawing on the board, but I'll help you understand it in a second. And by the time we're done, you'll be able to use these phrases like a native speaker. Okay, so let's go to the board.

First thing, E: "What are these types of words?" The first thing E will tell you is, well, first of all, they're different types of words so we can't say they're adjectives, they're this, this, and this. Each word has its own meaning, and sometimes they have two. I'm going to go to the board now and start working on that with you. All right? So let's get on this side.

So, let's look at the first one: "kind". "Kind" is a word you've probably heard before. "She is a kind woman.", "He has a kind face." And we mean nice and friendly. Now, you might not be aware that it also is a noun, as in category. If you look over here: What is "category"? It is people or things that have something in common; they share together. Okay? Like music. Music can be jazz, blues, classical, rock - they're in the category of music, not movies, because they're all types of, you know, instruments and people singing. So when you say: "What type of or kind of music do you like?" We're saying: "What category? Is it jazz? Is it rock?" because they all share music together, but there's something specific with each genre or grouping, so we say: "kind of", and that tells us what category.

And the next one we're going to talk about is "style". Now, some of you like my style, right? When we say "style", we say way of doing something, that's his style. So, some people like Michael Jordan, when he used to throw a ball he'd have his tongue out - that was his style. Not many NBA athletes do that, but he would, so you knew when Michael went: "Ah", he was about to jump and throw it.

Appearance, like my appearance. I love superheroes so I'm always wearing... Not always, but a lot of time wearing superhero clothing or costumes. And those of you who know me know I love Batman. So, when you talk about someone's style, you talk about their general appearance; what they wear regularly. Okay? Or their way of doing something, like I said, Michael Jordan.

We also use it for elegance, which means sophisticated, not common, above average. Usually people say elegant people have money, but it's not the case. It just means they have a certain way about them that makes them special, and people like it and respect it; to be elegant. But "style" also means... It's also a verb, as in to design. So when you design or make something in a specific way, it's that style. So if it's in the classical style, it's made like the classics. If it's in the modern style, it's made like modern things, like all white furniture. Okay?

Once we add "of", and you notice I added "of" to "kind of" to talk about category, once again, we get a noun. Right? So we go: "kind of", we become a noun... We can use it as a noun as well. Right? "Kind of" from grouping. Same thing, people or if things are together. So if you say: "What style of music do you like?" it's similar to saying: "What kind of music do you like?" Okay? The "of" brings these things together to give them something common or puts them in a given category, you might say.

Why am I teaching you this? To go back again, because a lot of times we say this when we want to talk about what groupings go together and preferences. There's a little bit more to it, which I'll get back to afterwards, but as long as you understand that "kind" with "of" and "style" with "of" are similar that they talk about category.

What's the next one I'm going to go to? Well, let's go to "type". Typing: "Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch", now, you do that on the computer. […]</media:description>

<media:description>Do you have any good or bad habits? A habit is something you do often. A habit can be positive or negative. For example, most people would say that smoking is a bad habit and exercising is a good habit. In this lesson, I will teach you expressions to talk about habits like "creature of habit", "break a habit", "force of habit", "old habits die hard", and more. We can also talk about habits without actually using the word itself, such as in "have an urge" and "fall back into". Watch the video to find out what these expressions mean and how to use them. It's a good habit to always do the quiz after watching: https://www.engvid.com/english-expressions-good-bad-habits/

TRANSCRIPT

Is somebody smoking in here? E, are you smoking again? What a nasty habit. "Habit". I want to teach you a new vocabulary word: "habit", and I'm going to teach you what it means, how to pronounce it, some idioms that go with it, a couple of other phrases we use to talk about habits, and then we're going to do a little test with some collocations. You ready? Let's go to the board.

Habit. Notice he said: "What a nasty habit." Well, what does that mean exactly? "Ha-bit", "habit", that's the proper way to say it when you see this word. It's a usual way of acting, so it's something you do on a very regular basis or you do it all the time. You will notice the word "habit" when we talk about the simple present because we use the word "habit" or simple present to talk about our habits. I like to eat hamburgers. It's like a habit. Not exactly, but you get the point. I do it regularly. I work at this school. It's like a habit because I do it regularly, or it's my usual way of acting or doing something. So now you can see why I'm teaching you this word because we use that word to talk about the simple present, which is grammar. You got a free grammar lesson there, son. I hope you're happy.

Let's go back to the second meaning. Something a person has done repeatedly until they don't have to think... Think when they do it. So, sometimes you're like... And someone goes: -"You're biting your nails." -"Oh. I didn't notice. It's a habit." It's a bad habit. There are good habits, by the way, and I'm going to just quickly talk on them before I go over here. Good habits are things like going to bed early. Right? Or studying with engVid, studying your English every night to make sure you get better at English. These are good habits. Brushing your teeth. Right? You know, remember: The habits you have will help you become the person you want to be. Keep that in mind. Okay? Now, as I finish that, let's go to the board and talk about habits.

See this one? This is Dracula. [Laughs] I want to bite your neck. He's a creature. You might say monster, but in this case, creature, monster, or animal. A "creature of habit" is somebody who likes routine. They like doing regular things. It brings them comfort or makes them happy. So some people like to go to work, after work come home, sit down, grab a beer, put the television on, and that's what they like to do. They don't want to party, they don't want to go see their friends or play video games. They want one or two beers, watch TV, go to bed. Creatures of habit. They like routine, they don't like it changed. Okay?

Number two. Hi-ya. That's a hand. Okay? This is wood. So sometimes in karate you see people go: "Ah-ya! Poof", and they break things. When you "break a habit" or if you need to break a habit it means end, stop the habit. You're tired of doing something like biting your nails. You go: "I need to end this. No more, no more, no more. I need to break that habit. It's embarrassing. It makes me feel bad or look bad." So you need to break habits. Remember, there are good habits, but to be honest, when we usually talk about habit in English it's usually bad habits. If you talk too much about your good habits, we think you're bragging or saying how good you are. "I save all of my money. I'm so good at saving my money. I'm the best." This reminds me of somebody. "I'm the best saver in the world. I'm the best doer of homework in the world. I always do my homework." I'll probably say: "Shut up. I don't want to hear anymore." We like to talk about our bad habits, and we tend to or we have a habit-[laughs]-of keeping our good habits to ourselves so people don't get angry.

Number three: "force of habit". Think of Superman. Dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh. Is very powerful, right? Can do many things. A force of habit means your habit, the repeated behaviour is so strong that you don't think about doing it. I mean, sorry, it just happens without you thinking about it. You know? I mean, sometimes you just have a... Oh, it's force of habit. I didn't even know I was doing that. It just went to my mouth.  […]</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Batman slowly turned over, and he saw his arch-villain or arch-nemesis, the Joker. Hey. Sorry. James from engVid. Just reading about the Batman. And Batman is famous for having his utility belt and tools to solve crimes. I'm going to use this shoe to teach you some vocabulary and some idioms. You guys ready? Or and some phrases. You ready? Let's go. Use this shoe. "Wa-cha."

All right, so Mr. E says: "I'm a shoo-in for this job." What the heck does he mean? He's actually wearing a nice pair of shoes, so it must be something serious. Let's go to the board and find out. Hmm. Here is a shoe, and you may notice in brown I have put one, two, three, four things about a shoe you may not know. I know you know what a shoe is-right?-basically, but did you know that these things here, we call them "laces"? Yeah, that's what you tie up. Someone will say: "Do up your laces." But there's also an idiom that comes from this. Now, what do you call the back of the shoe? We call that "the heel". Right? The heel of the shoe. Now, this part you can't really see, but it's the part that bends like this, we call that "the arch". That's where your foot kind of goes like this. And then finally, this is "the sole". Now, I'm not talking about the soul that goes to Heaven. Right? I'm not talking about the soul that goes to Heaven, I'm talking about the sole of your foot. So, it's heel, arch which is the middle part, and then the sole, and we've got our laces, and now we're ready to do our lesson. Let's go.

So, let's start with the shoe itself, the whole shoe and nothing but the shoe. The first one I want to talk to you about is about a "goody two-shoes". Now, if you're a goody two-shoes, it means you're a good, good person. You know, the person who does all their homework, comes on time, is very nice to everybody. You might be religious even, I don't know, but you're a really, really, really good person. You don't smoke, you don't drink. I know, if you're an engVid watcher, that's not you. Okay? Because you're on the internet, so I don't know what you're up to. But a goody two-shoes only does good things, never does bad things; no bad words, no alcohol, no anything that's bad. Goody two-shoes are usually children. Okay?

The next one I want to talk to you about with the shoe is "a shoo-in". And notice I said: "shoo-in". It looks like the word "shoe" here, but it's spelt differently, which might be a bit confusing. Well, that's because when we as English people say it, we don't really think of this particular verb, but we use the word, and when we use it we mean... If someone's a shoo-in, and usually for a job or a situation... He's a shoo-in for... To be her girl... Boyfriend. She is a shoo-in for the job. When we say it what we mean is they are the person candidate or the perfect person to get it. Okay? So, if you're going for a job, and let's say you're a lady and you're going for a job, and go: "She's a shoo-in for the job. She's got the right education, she has the right connections, she has the right experience." We mean you're the perfect one for the job. Now, remember I said it looks like this, but it's not like that? I've got to give you the real meaning behind it. See, this "shoo-in" comes from horseracing. You know horses? Well, way back what would happen is horses would be racing and then one horse was... That was winning would kind of go back and fall back, and the second horse would win, and it would become the winner, and it was called the shoo-in. "Well, why?" you're thinking: "That's like perfect candidate, right?" Not exactly. This is in what we call the fixed race. It means that the first person in the race... So let me get you some markers so you can see the difference. […]</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo. Oh, hi. James from engVid. Today I wanted to talk to you about two tips on conversation. These tips I think can have you... Help you have an amazing conversation, make you really interesting... Actually, make people really interested in you so you can keep having conversation. After all, it's the practice that we need to get better, and if people don't want to talk to you, you can't improve.

So quickly we'll go to the board and you'll see Mr. E has boxing gloves, and it says: "1, 2". In boxing, the "old one-two" is a jab and a straight punch. Why? It's very effective and it gets the job quickly done so you can take out your opponent. In this case, what I want to do is teach you two things that you can use in combination to make people you speak to enjoy the conversation with you, want to practice more, or talk to you more so you get more practice. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

So, how to knock them out with killer conversation tips, 1 and 2. For most people when they're practicing or when they want to improve conversation, they think: "I need to talk a lot because if I get to talk a lot I'll get better." That's 50% of the equation, because in any conversation there's the speaker and the listener, and both parts must be worked on, because if you have a healthy balance the person who is listening to you will want you to continue, but usually they want to speak as well.

In a lot of conversations, something that will make a conversation go well is empathy, which "empathy" means: "I understand what you're saying. I also want to know how you feel." Another part of it is energy, people want to be excited. Nobody wants to talk to a person who talks like this on the whole subject, it wants... It makes them want to stop talking to you. That energy or lack of energy can be on your part or their part. In this lesson I want to address both things, empathy and energy, to teach you how to raise the energy in a conversation if it's low; and teach you empathy, how to feel or get them to feel in the conversation so they care, because if they care, they share. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

Let's talk about empathy. One of the biggest parts of a conversation is empathy. When a person cares about the conversation, they stay in it, they're excited about it, so it's one way to raise energy. A lot of times when we're talking we make the mistake of thinking: "Okay, well, I've got a lot to tell people", and we get excited, so we have a lot of energy, you're talking about: "I got a new car the other day. It's an amazing car. It's got, like, bucket seats. The seats warm up in the winter. Canada's cold. The steering wheel warms up. I got a really good price on it. I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I..." the magic "I". Now, it's good for me because I get to say: "I", see? Me and I, but for a listener it gets boring because they're like: "Ah, ah". They want to talk. So a way to change that around, you might say: "Well, I'll just use 'you'. I'll say: 'How about you? You, you, you'". That's okay, that's a good start, putting it on them.

But if you want to show empathy to get them interested in the conversation, what you might want to say is one of two sentences I will show you now because when you say these sentences it makes the person know you care about them, not just about you. And in inviting them to speak about something gives them the opportunity to put their opinion in, so no matter how the conversation goes, they will remember that they were part of a conversation, not a lecture where you just spoke about you. And they will also probably remember the conversation in a more positive way, which means later on they'll want to talk to you. […]</media:description>

<media:description>Using the same word again and again is boring, which is why native English speakers use a wide variety of vocabulary to express their thoughts and feelings. In this vocabulary lesson, I will teach you how to express yourself more effectively by replacing the word "very" with more precise and interesting adjectives. For example, you can replace "very cold" with "freezing". This illustrates your point more precisely. You will sound more natural and intelligent. Using these adjectives on the speaking section of IELTS and TOEFL exams will impress your examiner and improve your score. Watch the video to discover many more examples of this kind of vocabulary substitution. Variety is the spice of life!

TRANSCRIPT

"Getting from here to there, it's been a long while." Oh, hi. My time is finally here. James from engVid. I can't believe this, this is like the Mirror Universe. If you watch Star Trek, you'll understand; if not, go watch Mirror Universe with Star Trek. I have two, look at them, I have two Mr. Es. In the first one Mr. E is hot, and the first one Mr. E is cold. Let's go to the board.

E, what's up? "It's very hot. 35 degrees centigrade." You're right. I see you're wearing your Bermuda shorts. And the second E is saying he's very cold: "It's minus 30 degrees centigrade." Ow, this isn't good. I feel for you. But don't you think there are better ways to say it's very hot or it's very cold? I think so, and in today's lesson I'm going to teach some of you... Not some of you. I'm going to teach all of you how to get rid of the word "very" to describe everything, and use other words which give more information, which will make you sound more like a native speaker and make your writing phenomenal. Oh, "phenomenal"? That's a word for "very good". Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

So, today's lesson is on "very". "Very" is a very good word, that's why we use it, but when you're writing, to hear somebody say: "Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very" is what we call monotonous, it means "mono" as one, "tonous", one tone, one sound - very boring. So let's change that from you being... You know, using "very" because I teach and I notice a lot of students saying things, like: "Teacher, today it's very cold outside." I'm like: -"Yeah, it is." -"And I'm very tired and very hungry." I'm like: "Okay, okay." It's like being punched in the face again and again, and I just want to say: "Stop with the 'very'. Use a different word." But it's not fair because "very" is a very good word-there, I did it again-we just need to find other words to make your language sound richer to improve it so you sound more like a native English speaker, and to make it more interesting for you because it will express more of who you are and your ideas in a better way. It makes you unique. You ready? Let's go to the board.

You'll notice I put "very" in red because this is something we don't want to do, we don't want to keep saying: "very". We want to change that up. And I'm going to give you a list of words that people or students usually say when they say "very" that I've heard many, many times. And maybe you've done this. And today I'm going to give you singular words to use instead. I'll explain them, just in case they're difficult.

Let's start with the first one. People say: "Very rude", instead of saying that, you can say: "vulgar". "Vulgar" means very rude, and if somebody says to me: "Your language is vulgar", I'll probably stop talking because it means it's not right, it's inappropriate, it's very bad. Vulgar. "I don't like your vulgar tone", your rude tone. It's strong. "Very short", another word we say is "brief", which means small. We had a very brief... We had a very brief conversation, a very short conversation. Cool?

"Boring". When you say: "Class was very boring today", you can say: "dull". "Dull" means very boring. It also means... See? Here's a bonus when you use these words, stupid. If you say someone is dull, you can say they're very boring, or dull meaning they're stupid. Don't use it like that too often; people don't like being called stupid. And if you say: "He's rather dull, isn't he?" I have to listen for context to mean stupid or boring. Next one, everybody's favourite: "Very good". "Teacher, the food is very good. The lesson is very good. I like this, it's very good." Why don't we change that to the word "superb"? Look carefully at the word "superb", you have the word "super" written inside it. "Super" means what? Above average, excellent, or superb, very good. "The food was superb." People don't usually use this word, so if you tell me when I cook for you that it's superb, I'm telling you right now I will take that as such an amazing compliment. Gentlemen, if you tell a woman she looks superb, she'll be like: "Thank you. Really?" Because no one says it. All right? […]</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Concentration. It is necessary to be really good at what you're doing. I wonder if we can play a game today.

Hi. James from engVid. I was reading a book on concentration, and it dawned on me... And "to dawn on you" means I understood something that a lot of times when we play games, we concentrate, we really concentrate, we enjoy it and we learn a lot. And what I'm thinking today is that I would like to teach you a game that could help you concentrate and learn grammar easily and make it fun. I know that sounds like that doesn't make sense, it's like opposites, but bear with me. Stay with me and let's see where we go. Okay?

So, Mr. E's playing a game. Some of you know this as tic-tac-toe, some of you know it as Xs and Os, and I'm going to use this game here to help you learn phrasal verbs. Very difficult subject for a lot of people, and today I hope to make it easy and fun. You will be able to do this by yourself and do it with a friend or family, or other students. You ready? Let's go to the board. Because as E says, he wins and you can, too.

So, first I'm going to look at is preposition, and I'm going to pick one. Because when we play this game of Xs and Os, you can see the board is here, we're  going to play and I'm going to teach you how to use this preposition with these verbs to create phrasal verbs. Now, one of the things we want to do is figure out what "up" means. You don't have to do this. You can just go in... You're on the internet, and you could look up these verbs, and see, you know, the phrasal verb "pull up", what does it mean? "Pick up", "close up", but today I'm going to help you with "up". We actually have a video with phrasal verbs on it, or many videos, where you can go and research and find out what these ones mean and other ones. And I believe I did one that gives you a method for "up", "down", and other phrasal verbs. Go check it out. www.engvid.com. Right?

So: "up". "Up" can mean more. Okay? "Increase", "closer", "improve", "finish", or "end". So, when you know that "up" can mean these things, it means when we use these words here, we add "up", it will change the meaning of each word and give it a new meaning with the two words combined. For instance: "pull up". When we pull up it means to get closer, so when an English-speaking person says to you: "Please pull up a chair", it means get a chair and sit close with us. "Pull up" means closer, move closer. "Pick up". "Pick up" has several meanings but I'm not going to go into all of them. I'm going to give you one that you can use now. If you say: "I will pick you up at 4 o'clock or 5", it means I will come to a place you are at, meet you, and we will go together. A lot of times when someone says "pick you up" it means they will either have a taxi or a car, and they will take you, transport you with them. That's why they're picking you up, or they would say: "I would come to your house".

"Close up", when you close up a store it means to shut, finish, and you end the work, so you close the door and go home. "We going to close up at about 6 o'clock." We will finish working about 6 o'clock. "Lift up", well, this pen, lift it up. We could say it more, and I should have added "move", right? Because when you lift something up, you take it from a lower position, you put it to a higher position.

"Brighten up". "Brighten up" means to go bright, so we go from... Well, let's look here: Purple, this is brightened up. It's not clean, it's not perfect, but it's brighter. Right? So "brighten up" means to give more light. Or it could mean make happier. "He brightened up at the prospect of going out." He got happier. "Hold up" means to make wait. If you're saying: "What's holding up the train?" It means: "Why is the train staying here? Why is it waiting?"

"Shot up", it means to go straight up. "The rock got shot up into the sky". "Clean up" means to clean. "Let's clean up the room." Let's clean it up, make it better. In this case, improve the condition of the room. "Take up" means review. […]</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas. Hi. James from engVid. Dreaming, what am I dreaming about? Well, this lesson, to be honest. I'm trying to find a way that would be easier to have difficult conversations. It's a dream, but it's a dream I'm going to help you turn into a reality. Today what we're going to look at is nine words... ten words to give you to use in conversations that you might find difficult in English that no one else has given you. I will give you some situations that you could use these words in, and then we're going to play, have a little bit of fun. Okay? It's something you can do by yourself, you can do it with a friend, or a group, and it will help you become more creative and a lot better with English, more like a native speaker because you'll understand what these words are and how to use them appropriately. Are you ready? Let's go to the board. As E says, these are difficult conversations. There are many different types, from relationship and work, so we're going to have a bit of fun. And I'll start off with the words first.

Let's look at the word "confess". When you confess something it means you must give the truth or tell the truth about something, something that someone hasn't known, you will have to tell them. Right? I have to confess that I like yellow and I'm wearing yellow underwear. You didn't know, it's hidden, but now you know.

"Resolve", it means to find a way. If you resolve to do something, you want to resolve, you have decided to do something and you've got a strong... A strong desire to do it. A resolve to lose 15 pounds means I've made a promise to myself to work towards that to do that.

"Regret". Regret, you say you're sorry, and it means I feel bad about it. When you regret you wish you didn't do it. I regret breaking off with a girlfriend five years ago because she would have made the perfect wife. I regret.

"Condolences", use this one what we call sparingly, which means don't use it a lot. Condolences... Or the word "condolence" is usually reserved for death. Okay? So, when you say "condolence", if you say: "I give my condolences", you wouldn't say that if someone lost their job. "Oh, you lost your job? My condolences." They're not dying. They just don't have work. Okay? They have a future. But if you hear someone is really sick, they have cancer, serious cancer or their parent or someone that they know has died, then you would say: "I offer my condolences." You can even use it for a pet, if their dog that they've had for ten years has died, offer condolences. It means I'm extremely, extremely sorry that this has happened to you. Okay?

"Empathize". "Empathy" is to feel like someone else. "Empathize" is to... We can understand and have... Share the emotion with you. We have that empathy. And I say, I see a poor person on the street, and someone says: "Look, they're lazy." I go: "Can't you empathize? Imagine what it would be like. Feel what they feel."

"Mend". "Mend" means to fix, fix something. You want to mend it. You can mend a relationship. If you're fighting: We need to mend this relationship. All right? We need to make it better, fix it. If you break your arm and it's fixed, the arm is mended, you go your arm will mend; fix.

I like "disillusion". "An illusion" is something you think is true, but it's not. It's an illusion. Magic tricks. Here you go, here it's gone. Whenever I go like this, there's the illusion that I've been standing here waiting for you to come back. Right? It's all cameras. To be disillusioned is to believe something was true and you find out it's not true anymore. You think your mother or father is the greatest person on the planet, and then you find out, just like you, they have flaws or weaknesses, and they make mistakes. […]</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Silicon Valley, security of the internet, aerospace, holter, capital inflation, ambitious... Oh, how am I going to remember all this vocabulary? This is so much to... I have an idea. Hold on a second. Excuse me, guys, I have to get a book. Where did I put...? Ah, there it is. A long time ago-hey, E, we're going to get to you in a second-I had a trouble remembering vocabulary for something I was studying, and it was so difficult, and I thought: "I know, my favourite hero is, like, Sherlock Holmes, and he has what's called a memory palace, and I think that's why E did this. He said: "I'm a king. Where is my palace?" Today we're going to work on a memory palace. For you it might be more, like, a memory house or a memory room, but as your memory gets better and better, we can make it from a room to a house to a palace. A palace is a house where a king lives or a queen lives, and is huge with many, many rooms and you can do many, many things. And after I show you this method, you will figure out that you might want to start with just a room, but from there you can go from a room to a house to a workspace, like your business place or workplace, to a palace because as long as you can remember the room, you can remember vocabulary. And today we're going to have some fun because I'm going to do... Well, we're going to go step by step and do this together. I'm going to ask you to do a couple of things, you'll do them and you're going to find that your memory has increased incredibly. And we can do it for many, many things. So you guys ready? I'll take a look here. Let's get started.

What do you need? Okay, you just need to right now sit down. I'm going to ask you to focus in a second or two, and then you just need to laugh. So if something's funny, laugh, have fun with it, and then we're going to see how much vocabulary you have. So the first thing I'm going to do is give you eight words. Number one: "bacon". Number two: "ball". Number three: "banana". Number four: "fish". Number five: "monkey". Number six: "Mr. E". All right, Mr. E. Number seven: "rat". And number eight: "dog". Got it? Cool. Now, what I want you to do is tell me all eight of those words. I'm waiting. I'm listening. Go. Go for it. In order. In order. Did you get all of the words? If so, good for you, you have a remarkable memory. You don't need me, turn off the video, go somewhere else. No, you better stay, because still can help you with more words than this. I'm just showing you eight because we have a limited time. Now, some people if they've done that exercise before, they'll go: "Oh, I recognize this", but don't worry about it. So, if you didn't do well, maybe you got four words or five words, but they weren't in order, you got them all over...

Let me give you the words again, but this time I'm going to ask you to join me and do something, and I bet you can know all the words and you can even tell me the words out of order. Okay? So, let's do this again. But this time... And here's the trick: You have to really put the idea in your head when I give it to you. Okay? You can't just go: "Okay, okay." You have to actually see it. Okay? And when I say laugh, I mean if it's funny make it crazy as heck, make it crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy in your head. All right? So let's do the first one.

I want you to imagine you're coming to a door. Okay? You come to a door, you open the door, and just before you open the door you see a piece of bacon, and the bacon's running from the bottom of the door, going: "Oh my god! Help me! Help me!" It's running out the door as fast as it can. It goes in fast motion, it runs out the door, and you're like: "Whoa! Look at that bacon run out the door.  […]</media:description>

<media:description>In this lesson, I will teach you twelve ways that we use body parts as verbs in English. Does that sound strange? Well, maybe it is, but these are verbs you will hear pretty often, so you should learn them. We will look at expressions like "necking", "shoulder a burden", "mouth off", "to eyeball someone", "skinned alive", and more. These expressions are commonly used by native English speakers and are useful in everyday life. When you're finished watching, head over to the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/12-ways-to-use-body-parts-as-verbs/ to test yourself!

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from engVid. I was going to try to... A shoe and a book joke, but I didn't think it would go well. But Mr. E is saying to me: "I gotta hand it to you." Right? "You tried." Yeah, I did try. Unfortunately I failed. Today I want to teach you about body parts as verbs, and how certain parts of our body, from our hands to our mouths, to our heads can be used as verbs and have a meaning.

Now, before I go any further, I want to say two things. Thank you to Baz and Tomo. Thanks, guys, you made this lesson possible with some of your suggestions. And if you guys have suggestions for me at all for lessons, please, don't hesitate. Go to engVid, www.engvid.com, and just say, you know: "Can you teach this, this, and this?" or "Could you help us with...?" and you might get your name on the board.

Now, I'm going to move on to our lesson, but just to point out because you grammar heads out there will say: "He wrote 'gotta', and that's not a word in English." You're right, this is slang. But I'm saying: "You gotta hand it to me", because I'm using one of these body parts as a verb right there: "hand it", it means have got to. "I have got to hand it to you." But in English, we say: "gotta" because it's faster and simpler. Right? So: "I have got to hand it to you" is very formal, "I gotta hand it to you" is very natural. Keep that in mind. If you're writing, write: "I have got to", but if you're speaking, you could say to a Canadian: "I gotta get going now", and they'll understand you have to go. Cool? All right.

Moving on. First things we want to talk about, and I tried to do this in order with your body so you will remember the order. "Head", I have a head. I cannot walk like this, it doesn't make sense. I turn my head in the direction I'm going. So, when somebody says: "Where are you heading?" they're saying: "I see your head is going in this direction. To where are you going?" So: "heading" means direction. "He was heading to his house", that means the direction he was going of his house. "She was heading to the store", she was going in the direction of the store. Number one: "heading".

Number two: "eyeball". "To eyeball somebody" is to look at them. Usually used in a negative sense. If someone says to you: "Are you eyeballing me?" It means: "Are you staring at me or looking at me? Because I don't like how you look at me, okay? Stop doing it." Okay? So: "to eyeball someone". Maybe you, you know... Sometimes you've seen women look at other women, and they look them up and down, like: "Look at her." They're eyeballing, because you can see their eyes moving and checking them out. Or guys eyeball each other, like: "Yeah, he thinks he's tough", and they eyeball you. Okay? Number two: "to eyeball".

Number three: "neck". I'm not a vampire, I don't... I don't want to bite you and get your blood, but "necking" isn't when two people put their necks together, but "necking" is kissing, but long-time kissing, so it's like you're with your partner: "[Kisses]". "Necking", okay? So that's why I have two lips, because they're kissing and that's why the two people are happy because messing... Messing. [Laughs] Kissing means... "Necking" means long-term kissing or long-time kissing and passionate kissing. Okay?

Number four: "mouth off". You can see the mouth is jumping off of a box. Let me finish that box, it doesn't look like a full box, there. So it's jumping off a box. "Mouth off" is to say things, like: "Get out of here. I don't care." It's being rude. Being rude, maybe sometimes using slang towards someone. So, for example, if your dad were to say: "Hey, could you pick up the box?" And you go: "Yo, old man, why don't you pick up the box? You're bigger than me, you should pick up..." You're mouthing off. I would say: "Stop mouthing off. Stop being rude." Okay? Or: "...talking back to me like that". "Mouthing off".

"Shoulder", "shoulder a burden", that's just one example, but when you shoulder something, like a responsibility, it means you carry it with you. You carry it with you. So if you're shouldering many responsibilities, maybe you are a student, maybe you're trying to learn English, maybe you have a job, maybe you have a fam-... That's a lot of things to put on your shoulders. Because shoulders are used to carry, so you're carrying a lot of these things on your shoulder. Okay? […]</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

I can, can't. Hi. James from engVid. This lesson, what I want to do is help you... Well, I want to help you improve two things at once, your pronunciation and your listening. Really, I will be focusing on the listening part, but if you do this right, your pronunciation will also get better. You ready? Let's go to the board.

As you can see, Mr. E has a big ear. Listening is one of those things when people are learning a language they don't really pay attention to. It's quite funny because I hear many people say right away: "I listen to English all the time. I listen to videos at home. Why? I don't need anyone to tell me about... Help me with listening." And usually the same people will say something like: "My pronunciation's not very good. I really don't understand when people speak to me", and so on and so forth. And you're trying to explain: Listening is a skill that is natural. Actually, there's a difference between hearing and listening, and we're going to go to the board right now and talk about that so that we can get to what I call "active listening". You ready? Let's go.

So, E, as you can see, has a big ear because he is now listening because he wants to improve on his listening skills and his pronunciation, and he's come to the right place. All right, so the first thing I want to look at here is "hear". When we use the word "hear" in English it's for sound, it really is. It's just for sound. Like... [Drops marker] Did you hear that? Right? You don't say: "Did you listen to that?" You can't listen to that. You can hear that. All right? So that would be music, when people are speaking, because if you can't hear... And here I wrote this: "If you don't hear it, it doesn't exist", and that's true. Listening... Or hearing is physical. Okay? The ear actually has to work, or you have to make it work. There are two things you have to be careful on, that your ear is good, so get a hearing test if necessary, if you need one; but also we can make it better, if physically everything works, sometimes people don't pay attention so they miss the sounds. And when you miss a sound, it changes the word and sometimes the meaning.

And that's when we look over here, to "listen". "Listening" makes us focus and gives us meaning. So, when you're listening to someone, you will look at them and you will pay attention, and that's how you get the meaning. You need to be able to physically hear the sound, which is true, but if you don't listen, you won't get the meaning of what they say. Okay? So we need a combination. And luckily for us, when the ear works, we can use our listening or our focus skills to improve how this works so we can get better at learning language and learn faster.

If you remember what I said here: If you don't hear, it doesn't exist. That's the physical part. If you cannot hear it, it doesn't exist. Right? Which will lead to bad pronunciation, because if you cannot hear a T, you won't say the T. "Huh? Hmm?" Yeah. For many Spanish people, the "d" sound is a "th". They cannot actually hear us when we say "duh", so they say: "the", right? So they go: "I stanthe", "I stanthe" instead of: "I stand". When they can hear it, because when I make them say the sound "d", they can do it, and "duh", they can say it, then all of a sudden they're like: "I can stand. He wanted". Not: "I wantith". -"I wanted". -"Oh, it's a different sound." By focusing and listening we're able to make them realize there are different sounds being said and improve on their pronunciation. Okay?

Now, if we use active listening, which is what I will teach you now, it will help us retrain the ear. "Retrain" means make the ear go back to the beginning and then start again, and retrain to make it better. Now, I have a little game we're going to play, which is a fun game because you can do it by yourself, -- I will give you an example in a second -- but you can also do it with a friend. "Huh?" So you can both help each other improve. So, I'm going to read something to you. Okay? And I want you to close your eyes and I want you to listen. Okay? Now, I want you to look for the words with the letter C. All right? So you're going to close your eyes, like I'm closing my eyes now. And I'm going to read this to you, and I want you to count how many C words are in this sentence. Are you ready? Are your eyes closed? Okay, do it now.

<media:description>Why is it so hard to understand native English speakers? Because we use relaxed speech. Most English speakers will combine words, leave out letters, and even change letters! But you can understand by learning how and why these changes happen. And when you understand, your pronunciation and comprehension will improve. In this lesson, I'll explain some of the most common pronunciation changes that English speakers make, so that you can understand what native speakers are saying. Once you learn these changes, practice listening for them with native speakers, or with your favorite English shows or movies. Find some usages of relaxed speech in a show or movie and tell me in the comments what you found.

TRANSCRIPT

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. What am I going to make for dinner tonight? Hey. James from engVid. Whaddya want to learn today? Excuse me. "Whaddya mean?" Oh, sorry, he's saying: "What do you mean?" What do you want to learn? We're doing two quick pronunciation tricks. When I'm saying that it's a little bit different, when I say two different pronunciation tricks, I'm going to teach you what's called relaxed speech in English or when we make... We blur words together. Sometimes we blur words, we make words, two words into one, sometimes three words become one, so when you hear it you think you're hearing one word, when in reality what you're hearing is three words and sometimes we drop the sound. Today I'm going to give you two very common phrases, that if you learn to say it properly, you'll sound like a native speaker, which is really cool. Right? So let's go to the board and take a look.

To start off with, Mr. E... Hey, say: "Hi", E. Okay? Mr. E is saying: "Whaddya mean?" Try it. If you look in your Google Translator or your phone, you'll notice this word doesn't exist, but it does for us English people, and in fact it's for two different things that are not related. I'll show you a trick so you know what it is you're saying; or when someone's speaking to you, what it is they mean. Let's go.

First things first, this is real English, relaxed speech. I have two statements. The first statement is: "What are you doing?" Right? "What are you doing?" Pretty clear and understandable. And the second statement is: "What do you want?" They're not the same at all, you can see with your eyes. But when I say it, actually it's going to come out like this: "Wad-da-ya doing? Wad-da-ya doing?" or "Wad-da-ya want? Wad-da-ya want?" The sound... This is phonetic spelling, so I'm just trying to show you the: "Wad-da-ya", "Wad-da-ya", basically sounds like this: "Whaddya", okay? And it's when we've cut sounds, and there's reasons we do it and I'll explain here why. When we speak very fast, especially when there's a "t" or a "d" involved in English, we tend to either change the "t" to a "d"-okay?-or we actually just get rid of it. An example is "often". In English you'll sometimes hear people say: "Often", "I often do this", but more casual is to say: "I ofen", the "t" is just dropped. It's understood to be there. Okay? "Often", but it's just dropped. And a lot of times people have trouble saying the word: "Bottle", you saw my face, like: "I want a bottle of Coke", it's difficult to say, even for us, so we say: "I want a bodle", "bodle", and that double "t" actually becomes almost a "d" sound, so: "bodle". "I want a bottle of Coke or a bottle of beer." We tell you to say "t", but we don't even do it ourselves because we're lazy.

And speaking about lazy, I want to talk about the second reason this funny thing occurs here where we have: "Whaddya" instead of the words that are supposed to be there. When we have lazy vowels... Lazy vowels we call the schwa, schwa. I'm exaggerating because I open my mouth too much. When you do the schwa, it's like an "uh", you barely move your mouth. In fact, later on I'm going to show you a test you can do to see the schwa for yourself. Okay?

Here's two examples for you because we barely say them, like the word: "problem". It's not "probl-e-m", you don't say the "e" really, you just kind of, like, make it fall with the "m" so it becomes "um": "problum". Right? And when you say: "family", do you say: "fam-i-ly"? No. You say: "Famly". It's "fam-ly", it just blends right in there. Okay? So now we've taken a look at this and "whaddya", and I just want to explain something, how it happened. Remember we said the "t"? The "t" gets dropped here. Okay? We just take it out. And the "r" we don't even say. It goes from here-you see?-there goes the "t" becomes a "d" there. Right? "What are", "What are ya", and we just drop it right off. Here it's even more obvious you can see it because we take the "t", and make that an "a" over here. We do that a lot in English with "o", we change o's to "a". Okay, so here are we. We drop that, we put the "t" to a "d" here, once again that drops off, and we have: "whaddya".</media:description>

<media:description>Learn English expressions that use colors like red, blue, pink, green, and white to talk about the way people feel or about situations people are in. These expressions are common and they also make your speech or writing more exciting and varied. I'll teach you expressions such as "tickled pink", "white as a sheet", "green with envy", "brown noser", and more. Do you know what the difference between "red in the face" and "blue in the face" is? I'll teach you, as well as review all the new vocabulary and expressions with practice sentences and lots of examples.

TRANSCRIPT

Hmm, hmm, this is really cool. Hi. James from engVid. Right now I'm kind of tickled pink about the information I just got from this. It's on answers while you sleep, lucid dreaming. Why am I telling you all this? Well, today I want to tell you how in English... Or show you in English how we use colours to talk about your mood or your emotions. All right? I'm sure in your own culture you use colour when you talk about something to describe how someone is feeling. And we have... I've got six for you, and I'm going to give you basically what they mean, and I'm going to give you some idioms that go with it. Later on I'm going to also do for you something a little else, I'll show you how we use colours to talk about behaviour, so not just how you think or feel, but how you act. Okay? Give you a couple of those, and then, of course, we'll have our quiz. So, you ready? Let's go to the board.

"How are you feeling today?" Well, E, how are you feeling? You're feeling a little flushed, a little blue in the face? No? A little red in the face? Let's go to the board and find out what these colours are. So, let's start with the colour that contains everything, white. When you are white it means you are afraid, scared. Someone might say: "You're as white as a sheet." The reason why they said that is because usually when we're afraid all of the blood goes from your body, from your hands and your feet to your heart so you can run faster if you need to escape. So your colour gets lighter. It doesn't matter what colour you are, funny enough, you get lighter. You can see it in some colour... People of different colours more, but generally put, it means your colour is not there because the blood is not there, you must be afraid. So you're as white as a sheet, like a ghost. Okay?

Let's go to the next colour, so we're going a little darker here, yellow. Now, I've gots a big belly. When somebody calls you a yellow belly they're saying: "You're a coward." It means you're weak, you're afraid. Now, this one you're afraid because something scared you. When you're a yellow belly, you're always afraid like a little mouse, you don't want to get into a fight or trouble, you might get hurt. So it means I can never depend on you when the situation is bad because you're too afraid to help. So, while being white means you're afraid of something that just happened, something has scared you, this one means you have no strength. You're the opposite of strong, you're weak. You're a coward, you're afraid of being hurt.

Let's go to red. Now, there are two types of red. Sometimes when people are turning red they are angry, like the Hulk. Except the Hulk turns green and we're not turning green. But when you see them getting... Their head starts getting redder and redder or darker in colour, usually what that means is the blood is rushing to their face. Now, in doing that, there are two meanings. The first one is angry. They're like: "[Breathes heavily]". And the face gets redder and redder. You go: "I think they're angry." And we will say: "He's red in the face." Angry, you can see it. You can see the blood and the heat. The second is turning red as in embarrassment. This is funny because in this case the blood comes to the face but it's from embarrassment. You're like: "Oh. My underwear is showing. Oh. I'm embarrassed", and your face gets red. Okay? So one is angry and you can almost feel the heat off of them, and the other one is: "Oh", embarrassment, shame. Okay? So, I'm telling you this because if you hear these two things, like turning red does not mean getting angry. Red in the face is angry, but this one, if someone says you're turning red, it means you've gone from being comfortable to being ashamed. Right? Or embarrassed of what has happened.

Let's go to pink. I said to you before I was tickled pink. When you tickle somebody, they: "[Laughs]", they laugh. Okay? So, tickling someone pink means to make them happy.</media:description>

<media:description>I know prepositions can be confusing and difficult for people learning English. Even people who have been learning English for many years and who have huge vocabularies and great grammar, still find it difficult to know when to use each preposition. One of the best ways to learn prepositions is to learn them in context. That means you learn the meaning of the preposition when it's used in a particular situation. Today, I am going to teach you about the prepositions "to", "on", and "about". We're going to focus on their usage with adjectives in sentences about behaviour -- that means the way someone acts. First we'll learn what these prepositions mean when talking about behaviour, then I'll teach you some common collocations that use these prepositions, and finally, we will test your understanding with some example sentences. Improve your grammar, comprehension, and English speaking confidence by watching this video.

Doo-doo-doo-doo. I really need to be less hard on myself about sports. Hi. James from engVid. Today's lesson is going to be about prepositions and behaviour. I want to show you how we use prepositions to talk about people's behaviour. Now, behaviour is how someone acts, their actions. You know, are they good to you, nice to you? So what is their behaviour like? Why is this important? Because you know prepositions is being used as one thing. Today I want to show you a lesson how we take the idea from the preposition, we put it with an adjective, and then we can talk about people's behaviour. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

"I need to be less hard on myself." Well, you know "need", you know "hard", but "hard on myself", what does that mean? Well, Mr. E is using a preposition, which is an adjective to talk about something he is doing or some way he is acting. Okay? "Hard" means strong, so he needs to be less strong on himself. In this case he needs to be nicer to himself. I used another one, "nicer to". We're going to work on this now and you're going to figure out how you can start using prepositions with adjectives to describe behaviour.

Okay, so, prepositions are most often used for direction, time, and the reason. The reason why. Sorry. The reason why we do something. Right? The reason why we do something. All right? "I'm going to the store", "I'll meet you at 12 o'clock", "I did it for this". Right? "For". But they can also be used to describe people's actions, or behaviour, or what they're doing. Okay? So I'm going to give you three popular prepositions: "to", "on", and "about". I will explain each one, and then give you some collocations which are words that go together, co-location. Right? Collocation, it means they're always generally found together, that will explain behaviour. Okay? Let's go to the first one.

"To". Everybody loves "to". Right? "To" means movement: "Go to the store." Right? I'm not going to say two people, because that's not a preposition, that's a number, but "to". But when we add... Use these adjectives before "to", we can say: "cruel to". "He's cruel to you". "Cruel" means not very nice. Cruel is not nice, so he's cruel... But, look. See how we have direction? Remember I said "to" means direction? "He's cruel to you." So the direction of his not-niceness goes to you. On the next one we have "kind to". "Kind" means nice. They are nice or generous. Right? So, when someone's kind to you, they are nice to-you got it, direction again-you. Direction. "Rude". You know when someone's rude they act in a way that's not nice, they show disrespect to you. Right? They say bad words or something. When someone's "rude to", here we go again, "to" means direction and that direction is to whoever they say, rude to them, rude to him, rude to me. Okay? Who is the object? And "helpful to", that's right. Somebody or something was helpful to you, they gave you some help when you need it. Help, and then full of help, they were full of help to you. So we've just discussed "to" and we know it means movement, and in this case direction, and these adjectives help us... Tell us what the behaviour or actions are that they are doing to you. Okay? You like that one? I got another one. It's a three-for-one sale, I'm going to teach you three. Okay?

"On". Usually when we say "on" we mean to put on, like on top, like on the surface of something, "on". As direction means... "To" means direction, "on" means on the surface or put it on. And as you can see, I put my hand on me which means something, I bet you're going to understand, is going to come on me. Okay? So we want to use these adjectives before "on". You can see my little picture, "on". "Tough on", you know, Colgate is tough on grease or tough on this. "Tough" means hard or strong.</media:description>

<media:description>You've been studying English for a long time. You already know that no matter how much you learn, it can be difficult to understand native speakers. They speak quickly, drop entire syllables, and stick words together. They don't speak exactly like the textbooks teach us, and in fact they make a lot of mistakes! In this video, I will explain clearly the "relaxed pronunciation" that native speakers use, and teach you how to listen so that you understand what they are saying. Once you have practiced this and can understand more of what you hear, you can start to speak like this yourself and be more fluent and natural while speaking English.

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from engVid. Do you ever notice how you don't always understand what English people are saying? It's like the words are kind of together? Well, I'm going to tell you a secret: You're right. It's called relaxed sple... Spleech? Speech, or blended speech. See, I put spleech together? And it just makes sense. And I'm going to get to that in a second, and I'm going to give you a visual so you can understand where we're going.

Notice E is relaxed, he's not really trying hard. When you're speaking your natural language you don't want to try hard all the time. Right? So I actually use another one: "wanna", which I'm not going to talk about today. But we're going to get there. Right? We're going to get to the board and take a look at what I want to teach you. It's how to sound like a native speaker, but also how to understand a native speaker. Okay? Because we do this blending or relaxed speech quite regularly. All right? So it's actually almost more normal... A more normal part of our language.

So what is relaxed speech? Well, relaxed speech happens when a native speaker... Speakers-sorry-change sounds or drop letters or syllables when they are speaking fast for things they say a lot. I'll give you an example. Nobody wants to say: "Do you want to go to the movie tonight?" So we say: "Do you wanna go to the movie?" For you, you're like: "What happened?" Well, we dropped the "t"-okay?-and we combined "want" and "to". We even change the "o" to an "a" to make it easier, so: "You wanna go?" For you, you're thinking: "Youwannago", that's a new English word: "youwannago". And it's like: No, it's not. It's "wanna" as in "want to go".

Another one is: "See ya". In "see ya" we change and we drop the ending here, we put: "See", and "you" becomes "ya": "See ya later". No one says: "See you later." It sounds weird when I even say it to myself. "See you later. Bye." But: "See ya later" rolls off the mouth. It's because both of these things we say at least 10, 20, 30 times a day, so we change it, we make it relaxed to make it comfortable like E. Okay? Problem for you is you go to school or you're reading a book and it says: "Do you want to", "Did you ever", no one speaks like that but you, so today we're going to change that. Okay? So I'm going to teach you, as I said, how to understand it when it's said to you, but also how to get it out.

Warning: Please use the books first or, you know, listen to... We have other videos on pronunciation, use those first. You have to master the base sounds first. You have to be able to say: "Do you want to", because what you don't understand is when I say: "Do you want", when I change it to: "Do you wanna", I almost say that "t", so I have to have practice saying the proper sound before I can drop it. Got it? It's like you got to practice a lot before you can play well. Okay.

So, once you've got that down and you start using this, people will go: "Hey, man, where are you from? Because I hear some accent but I really can't tell. Do you want to tell me?" And I say... I did it again. "Do you want to tell me?" You're like: "Woo, no. It's my secret, engVid."

Okay, anyway, so today what I want to work on specifically is "do" and "did". Okay? Because there are a few things we say, and there are what I call sound patterns for the relaxed speech that you can learn to identify what people are saying to you. Okay? So I'm going to come over here and I want you to take a look. "Do" or "Did", and here's the relaxed version of it. When we're done this we're going to have a little practice session because with pronunciation it's important you actually practice it, not you take the lesson, you go: "Thanks, James, you taught me and now I know." You actually have to go through it. So the first one we want to do is this one: "Do you want to", easy enough. Right? "Do you want to go to dinner? Do you want to have a friend over? Do you want to have pizza?" When we actually say it, what happens is there are two cases here. In the first case: "do" or "d" changes to a "ja", "ja" sound. And it comes: "Jawanna", so this is gone, the "d" is gone, we changed it to a "j". And remember what we talked about with "wanna"? The t's gone so it becomes: "Jawanna".</media:description>

<media:description>Neither &amp; nor, either &amp; or, both &amp; and, not only &amp; but. These are "correlative conjunctions". You've probably learned to memorize these pairs, but I'm going to teach you to UNDERSTAND when and how to use them. Instead of focusing heavily on grammar rules, join me and we'll talk about the situations where these correlative conjunctions are used in English. You'll learn how these pairs can be used to express choice, surprise, inclusion, or negation. It may sound difficult, but trust me, you'll understand it in no time.

TRANSCRIPT

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Ex my... "Neither you nor your hairy-ass friend can come to my party!" E! That's so rude. Hi. James from engVid. Today's lesson is going to be on correlative conjunctions, or let's say conjunctive pairs to make it simple. Mr. E made a statement where he said two things using two words to bring two statements together, two related ideas and brought them together. In this case: "you" and "your hairy-ass friend". I want to go to the board and I want to explain the correlative conjunctions to you, because I know conjunctions you've heard of, but this will be a little twist that can add to your English to make it more advanced. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

All right, so E talked about correlative conjunctions, and what I want to do is just go over conjunctions basically to you. Okay? So, conjunctions like: "for", "so", "because", "and", and "or" are easy. You know, they're everyday words. You say them regularly. "My friend and I", "You", or "Him", or "Her". Right? And we use these to join words, clauses, and phrases together. Right? "The people I saw and my best friends were happy." Okay? So, a correlative conjunction is the same kind of thing as, like, your joining statements, but they're of... Sorry. "Of", not "or". Of related information. And when they come together... When I say pairs, it's like imagine a boy and a girl together and they're a happy couple, they work together. Okay? So, "either", "or" is one of the first examples. You've seen "either". Right? Or you've seen "or", but what I want to talk about is "either", "or". In "either", "or" it gives you a choice. "Either you pay me the money now or I break your legs." You have a choice; whether you like that choice or not, it's a choice.

The second one is also... Is: "not only", "but also". It's about surprise. In the first case we're saying: "Not only was she happy"-there was a surprise-"but she also got married", there's even more surprise. So, in this correlative pair we talk about the idea of surprise. You put this plus this, there's a surprise, plus more surprise.

In our third case we talk about negation. That's what I was talking about, Mr. E here said: "Not you, nor your friend". A lot of students have a problem with "neither", "nor" or "neither", "nor". By the way, they're the same thing. You'll hear people say: "Neither this" or "nor". My idea on that or my take on that is this: A lot of educated people will say: "Neither", and it's more British. And Americans tend to say: "Neither" more. Is there really a grammatical difference? Not at all, but just keep that in mind that if you hear someone say: "Neither" they probably have gone to university, a little bit more educated, and "neither" is just more commonplace. It's not better, it's not worse, it's just a preference in style. Okay? But when you say "neither"... "Neither", "nor", it means not this and not that. It's not a choice. People confuse "either", "or" because you have a choice. This means: This is not true and that's not true, so both are not true anymore. Cool? Keep that in mind. It makes everything negative.

And finally: "both", "and" is inclusive or including. You know: "Both my brother and my father love baseball." So I'm taking two, right? "Both", my brother, I am saying there are two parts, and the secondary part is included with the first part, so it's an including. Cool? Now, we've got the basic lesson down. We're going to go to the board, of course you know I'm going to give you a bit of a quiz. I hope you understand. I'll go over it quickly for you once again just in case. "Either", "or" is choice; "not only", "but also" is surprise and it's two surprises, the first case is a surprise, the second one is even more of a surprise; "neither", "nor" is negation, meaning no, x, nothing, no; and "both", "and" is included, so you're including this with that, both she and he were happy. Right? Cool? All right, so once again we're going to do our magic board. Got to do a little bit of a quiz, and I'll give you a little bit extra on conjunctions in just a second.

<media:description>Improve how you sound in English by mastering when these three words are used! I've met thousands of English learners at all levels. Most of them, even the advanced students, make mistakes with the words "a", "the", and "to". These are some of the most common words we use, so in this lesson I'm going to teach you how we use these words. I don't want to look just at grammar; I want you to understand these words and why we use them. If you're an advanced English student, this will be a great review for you. If you're a beginner, try to understand this and save yourself years of English mistakes.

TRANSCRIPT

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. The things I do for love. There's not a thing... Hi. James from engVid. Today's lesson is about instantly improving. Now, I know... "Instant", what does that mean? People say it all the time. I want to show you a little trick that will make your English sound better instantly, and I will give you a technique that you can use after to help practice this. What I have found are students have a mistake or make a mistake when they drop these three words, and because of that I know you're not a native speaker. But today I'm going to address that, show you the three words... Okay? Explain why, and then I will give you a technique that you can use at home soon as you go back over this video or any video to practice it, and you will get instantly better. 10-20%. Okay? Want to know what I'm talking about? Let's go to the board and look at something you've learned, but today you're going to understand. You ready?

So, Mr. E said: "Which three words can help you sound like a native speaker?" I'm going to help you a little bit by doing this, and then we're going to go to the board. The words I'm talking about, and you might not consider them words but they are words are: "a" or "an"... Okay, and I consider that one word because it's modified. Right? "The" and "to". Of course you're going to say: "Yeah, James, we know all these. We learned this at beginner, so how does that instantly help me improve my English?" The problem is this: When a person knows something they will talk, when they understand they will change their behaviour or they will use the information. Many students know about articles and the preposition "to", but they actually don't use them in sentences. Many times I've heard students go... Say: "I need to go work tonight." Soon as you say that I know you're not a native speaker. Or if they say: "I bought car yesterday" or "I bought food..." Not "some food". "I bought apple yesterday at the store." I'm like: "A-... You mean an apple, right?" They don't think to say it, because they know: "Teacher, you know what I'm saying." And I go: "Yeah, I know what you're saying, but the way you said it I know English is not your first language." So what I want to do is get you to come back to understanding, not just knowing why these words are important, the fact that, especially with the articles we're going to talk about, they are in most of the sentences. You can almost not get by a sentence without using them.

So let's go to the board and take a look. First, what is an article? Well, you'll see an article is the letter "a" or "an". Quickly on that one, "an" is used when we have a vowel sound, sound... Not a... Not just a vowel. So when you say: "A apple", we know "a" and "a" make it difficult for us to actually get it out and for you to understand, so we add: "an" to put a consonant to make it easier for the listener. "I want an apple." Oh, okay, cool. How about "hour"? Teacher, that has an "h" in front of it. I'm like: "Enh?" But we say: "hour", we don't say: "h-our", because with "a" we have to say: "an hour", and that once again tells me one hour. You keep noticing I keep saying "one". I'll explain in a second.

Now, this is what we call and indefinite article. I.e. it's not special. When I say to you: "I want a marker", a marker. All right? I'm talking about this. See this? They're all basically the same. I don't care what type of marker. "A" just means generally speaking marker. That's why it's indefinite; it's not special. When we look at the word "the", "the" is special. In this case, when I say to you: "I want the marker", which one do you think I'm talking about? Can you see the difference? Clearly. Even if you don't know, you would look and see four, and see this and go: "He's probably talking about this one." So with a definite article what's happening is someone is being very specific. Well, there are two things. They could say something is special or something is specific. Okay? And here we have definite article is "the". "Tell the man I like him." Okay? "Tell the man", in this case both of us have to know what you're talking about, because if there are 10 men you'll go: "Which man?"</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. What's the name of that director? It's just on the tip of my... Oh. Hi. James from engVid. Today I want to teach you about a word "tip". We use this word a lot in English, and I am going to teach you what it means, some collocations-and collocations are words that are found together generally, you know, a lot-and a few idioms. If you're ready, we'll go to the board, visit Mr. E and start our lesson. Let's go.

So, E has "tip", he's pointing to his tongue and he's pointing to these icebergs, and he's pointing to the tip. So I've got an idea that "tip" has something to do with the edge or the pointed part of something. Hmm? Well, here's our word: "tip". For pronunciation, you go: "t-ip". Right? "ip", "tip", like: "dip" or "sip". So that's pronunciation. I think it's very important that you not only know what the word means, but how to say it or how to recognize it when you hear it. So that's our lesson for the day.

The two basic meanings of "tip" are: A) a gift of money for service. Not everywhere in the world this happens, but in North America and in England, if you go to a restaurant, when you... Oh, sorry. Not England. [Laughs] In North America, which is Canada, the United States, not including Mexico, but in these two countries after you finish a meal you are kind of obligated to leave a little extra money if the service is good. So if you liked the waiter or waitress, they do a good service, you leave money and it's called a tip. It's a gift for good service, like: "Thank you. I really appreciate it. Here you go." We also do this for taxis. All right?

Now, the pointed end of something... Here's my tongue and the tip, the tip of my tongue. That's the tip of my tongue, ah. But also with this marker, that's the tip of the marker. It's pointed and it's the very end. And that should help you understand why E was pointing to the tip of the iceberg which is pointed and the tip of his tongue. With these two ideas we're going to now move into how we can use "tip" like a native speaker, and some idioms as well. Okay? To make English fun and understandable.

The first one we talked about, "tip" at a restaurant. Money. But do you know "tip" is also for information? Remember we said it's the tip or the pointed end? Well, it's the beginning of something. When someone gives you a tip, they might come to you close and go: "Hey. I've got a hot tip." So, "tip" here could also be hot, and that means like it's special information, important information. Something they want to tell you that's going to benefit you. "Hey, I got a hot tip about a car selling for a really cheap price and it's in really good condition." It's special and it's for you. It's pointed to you. All right?

This one's a funny one. If you... [Laughs] Another meaning for "tip" is to make something... If it tips it will fall over. So it means on an angle to fall. Right? It tipped over it went: "Wuh, boom". It tipped. "Tip" means to fall over, but in North America there's a little habit people have of cow tipping. I don't suggest that you do it, it's not funny because the poor cows, they sleep standing up. And some people will go to farms and they will push the cow, and the cow will fall over, wake up. "Moo. Who mooved me?" It's not nice. Don't do it. All right? That's number three. So, "tip" here also means to make fall over.

So these are three basic pieces of information about "tip". One is tip given for service; two is for information that you give to someone, especially a hot tip; and three if something's tipping over like a book or a glass, it's going to fall. All right? And we did talk about the pointed end of something, and that's where we lead to here. "Tip of the iceberg". See how big icebergs are? Okay? Well, they're very tall. If you look here you see this part here, yeah? Well, that's a smaller part of something larger. So if someone tells you something, like: "And then he did that, and that's just the tip of the iceberg", that means that small part is nothing compared to how much more is coming. There's an enormous or a great amount of information, or other things about to happen. Right? So: "We went to the party, and we got shrimp to eat. But that was the tip of the iceberg. Then there was lobster, there was a pasta dish. It just went on and on." And you're like: "Wow! That's a lot!"</media:description>

<media:description>In this video, I will go over the different parts of speech in English. We will be looking at the use of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. You will also learn how to arrange them in a grammatically correct sentence. Also, I will teach you in what order to place the adjectives if you have more than one. For example, do you have a "big, white, excitable dog" or a "white, excitable, big dog"? Find out by watching this lesson and doing the quiz afterwards at https://www.engvid.com/basic-english-grammar-parts-of-speech/

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from engVid. I would like to talk about something that will help you understand English, and it's two things. Number one are parts of speech. What are the parts of speech and how do you use them? The second is called syntax, which is a very complicated word for word order. Where do you put the words in a sentence? In some languages they have a different word order, some languages it doesn't really matter, but what my job today is, is to show you where the words go and: What do they basically mean-okay-in the parts of speech? As E said: "Words. Where do they go?"

Now, if you're new to English or even if you're an intermediate student, sometimes this causes you problems. Right? You've heard the terms: "preposition", "determiner", "syntax", and you're like: "Oh, it's so complicated." Today's lesson will be simple. You can go over this again and again. It will help you understand and use English better.

So I'm going to start off with the most basic part of parts of speech, and I want to start with the things part. Things. Not actions, but things. I am a person. My watch is a thing. Okay? An animal, a cat or a dog, or an apple, these are things. We call these things nouns, because nouns name people - Hi, I'm James; places - Toronto, Ontario; things - my watch; animals - a cat, meow; and food - an apple. Okay? These are nouns. Example: boy, dog, apple. Okay? Nouns name these things.

But sometimes you don't want to keep using the same noun again and again. "James ate the apple and James walked his dog as James talked to his friend, Oliver, and then James..." It gets what we call repetitive and boring, and it also makes the sentences go really slow. And sometimes we want to use the noun in a different way. So in this case we introduce what's called pronouns. Pronouns can replace nouns in a sentence. So now you could say something like this: "James ate the apple and he walked his dog." Instead of: "James ate the apple and James walked his dog", we can use a pronoun to replace it and make it simpler. We still know we're talking about James.

Now, we talked about word order or syntax. Let me explain this. In order to use a pronoun first you must use the noun. Okay? You introduce the noun and then you can replace it with a pronoun. That's why you see number one then number two. You cannot just start with a pronoun. If I started a sentence at the beginning: "He went to the store." The very first thing you will say to me is: "Who's he?" I go: "Oh, James went to the store and he bought the apples there." And you go: "Oh, now I know who he is." So, pronouns kind of number two because you have to actually introduce first with a noun, then you can replace it with a pronoun.

Now, we have several types of pronouns. I'm just going to go over and show you a couple of them so you get an idea. Pronouns include: "I", "we", which are subject pronouns. Object pronouns when we're talking about something that's not us, but something on the other side that receives action, as a subject pronoun I do things. I run. Right? We eat dinner. We're talking to them. Now, when we say "them", you go: "What?" Well, they are receiving it and we call those object pronouns. Okay? So the most basic ones are subject and object pronouns. One is doing something, one is receiving. There are reflexive pronouns, like: "himself" where somebody is talking about themselves. "He built the house himself." So he's talking about him as an object, but reflecting it back to himself. We call it reflexive pronoun. Okay? There are others, but I'm not going to get into them right now because I want to keep this simple just so you know what the parts of speech are, and you can always come to engVid to come and see other lessons in which we go deeply into reflexive pronouns, object and subject pronouns. Okay? Cool. So we talked about how pronouns can replace nouns, and we're good with that. Yeah?

So let's go to stage number three, because once you've replaced them, how do you know the difference between them? Apple, apple. I don't know. That's when we have adjectives. Adjectives. The word itself can be broken into two parts: "ject" and "ad". But remember... Do you remember when I said subject and object, and I gave you the example? I said, for instance: "I" is a subject pronoun. Right? Subject, yeah, I'm good at this.</media:description>

<media:description>Head, ear, chin, lip, arm, chest, leg, foot, back... These are some of the body parts that are used in many common expressions in English. In this English lesson, I'll teach you the meaning of useful expressions like "You're always on my back", "Keep your chin up", "raises an eyebrow", and even some strange ones such as "makes my blood boil". These sayings bring your English to life by expressing how you feel. From head to toe, all body parts are covered. Watch the lesson to learn more. I know you'll give it a thumbs up!

TRANSCRIPT

E, what did I tell you about leaving your socks on the fl...? Hi. James from engVid. Little upset now. E leaves his socks all over the place. He only has one foot, but he seems to leave them everywhere. I'm always on your back? This lesson is about body parts, like the back, and how we use them to show or express our feelings, emotions, or thoughts on a situation. Stick with me, and we'll take your head out of the clouds and teach you some English. You ready? Let's go to the board.

Notice E is saying: "You're always on my back!" Well, I'm going to come over here and I'm going to show you the body parts, and then I'll show you an idiom... Or, sorry, let's say a phrase or an expression that we use to indicate our thoughts or feelings on something, or about someone. Right?

So, why don't we start with...? Well, what does it say here? Number one, your head. Okay? Your head. If someone says: "Your head is in the clouds", you're a dreamer, which means you don't really think about real things; work, eating, life. You're thinking: "One day I'm going to fly off and I'm going to visit a country, and I'm going to..." And someone will say: -"Do you have money?" -"No." You're a dreamer. Your head is in the clouds. Right? Get your head out of the clouds. Come back to reality. Come back to the real world. That's number one: "head in the clouds".

Let's look at number two: "let your hair down". This is kind of funny because I really don't have any hair. Let's just say I had hair. Okay? And my hair is up, like this. Okay? My hair is up. Okay? If I let my hair down, I'm going to relax. My hair is now relaxed. You like that? Purple. It's cool. "Let your hair down" means have fun, relax, take it easy. Don't be so serious. Okay? And that's our hair there. Just see that? Let it down, relax a bit.

How about number three? "Be all ears". Well, clearly I have only two and I cannot be covered with ears, but "be all ears" means I am focused, I am incredibly... I'm listening to you right now, incredibly focused. So when someone is all ears, it means I'm listening, you have my attention, I'm not thinking of anything but what you are saying. "Be all ears", and there are your ears. Okay?

How about this one? "Lip service". Those are little lips. Maybe you can't see them. So here are mine. Lips. Lip service is funny. "Service" means to do something for someone. But "lip service", it's actually... Because I have "insincere", but that might be a big word for you. But it means I don't really believe it or I don't really want to do it. So, when you give lip service you say: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah", but you really aren't going to do it or you really don't believe in it. Example: Your mother comes home and said: "Okay, you know what? You put the plate over there and the cup over there. Could you do me a favour? Could you pick it up and put it away?" And you're watching or playing video games or soccer, and you're like: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh." You have no intention or you're not going to do it. You just say: "Yeah, yeah, yeah" to make your mother happy so she thinks you're going to do it, but you're not going to. If your boss or employer gives you lip service, they say: "Sure, we'll give you more money. Everything will be okay. Just go back to work." It's lip service. They're not going to give you any more money, but they expect you to go back to work. Watch out for lip service. Right? Lips.

Let's look at number five. Chin, this is your chin right here. If you've ever seen Superman, Superman has a chin of steel. Big chin. Okay? Now, when somebody says: "Keep your chin up", your chin is probably here and you're: "[Whines]". You're upset and they say: "Keep your chin up. Don't be sad. Be happy. Be strong, like Superman." That's your chin right here, right underneath your lips. Chin. Okay?

"Be on someone's back", that's what E was saying. Well, if you've ever had to carry something really big, I don't know, like... Hold on a second. I'm still here. This is on my back. It's really heavy and it bothers me. You know? It's a pain. It's upsetting. When something's on your back, it's always... They're always bothering you. "Oh, you're always on my back asking about giving you money" or "You're always on my back asking me to help you.</media:description>

<media:description>Have you noticed that when native speakers talk quickly, they often shorten their words or even completely delete some sounds? This makes it challenging for English learners to understand fast speech, because the words are not pronounced in full. In this lesson, I will teach you about the silent H and how to recognize it to understand fast speech. I will also show you how to cut out the H at the beginning of certain words in order to sound more like a native English speaker. Improve your pronunciation by using the silent H, and see how much of a difference it can make!

TRANSCRIPT

I've 'ad a long time to work on this lesson, and I bet what I just said went right by you. Hi. James from engVid. Today I want to talk about letter deletion. In English we do this a lot, and I don't want you... So I want you to understand: I don't want you to use it, but I'm going to teach you how to hear it, how to understand it, where it is commonly used so you can quickly identify when we're speaking quickly. Like when I said to you: "I ave", I said: "I have", but I dropped the "h" and that's today's lesson. We'll do other ones where I'll drop a "t", but for right now I want you to concentrate on the dropping of the "h", and we call it the "H deletion" or "H deletion" if you're American. All right? Let's go to the board.

You'll notice over here, my man, Mr. E, he has: "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, ?, I", the deletion of H. Quick note. Okay? When we want to be clear on what we are saying we say each word exactly and precisely. Okay? However, when we say something regularly-okay? This is the examples of why we delete it-or we speak quickly or fast, we drop sounds. One letter we do this with is the letter "h". Okay? So as you can see, that's going to be my quick explanation on that, but I'm doing this sort of like a warning for you, this little part because you are not allowed to do this because you have an accent and you haven't mastered the English sounds. First you have to master the sounds, so it's better to say: "I have" instead of "ave", "I have", right? Master the sound. The second thing is this lesson's more about helping you to comprehend or listen to English, and understand English quickly. Okay? Are you ready? Time for me to do that magic board thing. [Snaps]

So let's talk about where the letter "h" is commonly deleted. We know it's deleted, but I'm going to give you about five examples or six where you can see the letter "h" is deleted often or quite commonly. Okay? Remember I said we do it when we speak quickly or it's something we say regularly? So it won't be a surprise when I show you the examples on the board, why this would happen. The letter "h" is commonly dropped when we use the verb "to have" or when we use pronouns. So, "have" in this case becomes "ave". "Has" becomes "azz", and I'm putting the "z" sound because pronunciation, it's not "a-s". I know you "ass" for some of you, I know people who speak Spanish or have a Latin background will "ass", because they see the "s", but we say the "z" sound: "azz". And "had" becomes "ad". "E 'ad about five minutes before e 'ad to leave." If you're really careful... Well, you have to go over here to hear what I actually said, but I used two of them at the same time and it commonly happens, so much so that we as English speakers don't realize we're not actually speaking the language, but just sounds. All right?

Let's go over to the pronoun side of the board. Okay? Well, the pronouns you'll see we have "he" becomes "e". Right? "E's a really good guy", and I'm not talking about Mr. E. "E's a really good guy", instead of: "He is a really good guy." Okay? "Her", I don't know err very well. I don't know err very well. It's not "her". "I don't know her very well.", "I don't know err very well." And "iz". Right? I know it's "iss", it looks like this, "his", but this makes this sound, the "iz" sound. Right? "Iz brother iz a good friend of mine. Iz brother is a good friend of mine." Notice how I'm speaking quickly, and for some of you I always speak quickly. But generally speaking: "I don't know iz schedule. I don't know iz schedule." It's not: "I don't know his schedule."

Now, once again, I need to repeat this: You do not use this when you're speaking. I'm giving you this, I'm giving you these examples by saying them so as you hear me say them you're like: "That sounds familiar", and that's why sometimes you think you know what we're saying, but you're not too sure. It's because we delete these sounds. Now, if you saw what I did here I actually at the beginning played with you by I said: "E ad about five minutes." And I said: "E ad", so instead of: "He had five minutes to talk", "E ad five minutes to talk to us, then E had to go. I don't know if err brother's coming, err brother's coming."</media:description>

<media:description>"Stop making mistakes" or "stop doing mistakes? "Do" and "make" are some of the most used verbs in English, but they are regularly confused by English learners. I'm going to teach you the logic of when to use "make" and when to use "do". Watch this lesson and you'll understand how to use these verbs correctly. You'll also learn collocations: words that often go with "make" and "do", like "do the dishes", "do your homework", "make dinner", "make a call", and many more. Learning to use these two simple words correctly will make you sound much more fluent to native English speakers, so don't miss out! 
https://www.engvid.com/make-or-do/

TRANSCRIPT

"To be or not to be?" that is the qu-... No, it's not the question. You are here to learn a lesson. Hi. I'm James from engVid, and today's lesson is going to be on "do" or "make". Well, why am I doing this lesson? Many students make a mistake with these two verbs. Okay? And the problem is native speakers almost never make this mistake, and as soon as you make this mistake we will know that you are just learning English or low-level English. So this lesson will help you fully understand how to use it so that you can start speaking like a native speaker right away.

Now, in order to do that we have to clearly know what the difference is between "do" and "make", and then give examples of how we use them. I'll also give you collocations. Collocations are words that go with "do" and "make" regularly so you know even if you're having a difficult time, when you say something like: "cake", you're going to say "do" or "make". Let's find out in five seconds, shall we? Let's go to the board where I'll break down what "do" is and give you examples; what "make" is, give you examples; then I'll give you those collocations and a short quiz. All right.

E, what is it, "do" or "make"? When I makes me a cake, do I do me a cake or make me a cake? Well, let's find out. If an action is repetitive, something you do on a regular basis, we're going to use the verb "do". Now, I should note very quickly here I am not going to talk on the auxiliary, like: "Do you like that?" I'm not going to ask these questions. We have other videos, so please go to engVid, go check them out, and they'll clearly do... Do, [laughs]. Show you the uses of "do" as the auxiliary. Okay? This is specifically how you understand it.

If something is done repetitively, we use "do", which is true for most simple present verbs. When we talk in the simple present it's about repeated actions. So, "do" is no different from that. Okay? Obligation. An obligation might be something like I do homework every night. It's a thing I must do. Okay? So we use it for obligation. Multiple actions. Now, listen to me carefully. "I do the dishes." I'll give you a visual representation or a visual picture of it in a second, but I want you to understand the concept.

A lot of times in English we use what's called "shorthand". Instead of saying every verb that I'm going to do, what I do is I use... Or I even said it here, replacing verbs. We put the verb "do" in and it talks about several actions in one go. Here's an example for you: When I do the dishes, I wash them, I dry them, I put them away. Notice there are three verbs. I don't want to say when someone says, like E goes: "Did you do the dishes?" Go: "Yes, I wash the dishes, I dry the dishes, I put the dishes away." They'll go: -"You new to Canada, correct?" -"Yes, very correct." Okay, so I said: "I'll do the dishes" or "I do the dishes". So, even under obligation I said: "I do the dishes every night", that's my obligation. And it's these actions I'm talking about. Repetitive because I do it every night, I repeat it. Okay? Multiple actions, so I've just went through, and replacement of verbs. This is similar to multiple actions, but you can use the verb "to do" to replace one verb, like: "Hey, man. I got to do my hair tonight." That means "fix", that might be cut my hair, it might be wash my hair, but when I got to do my hair, I got to do my hair, and do my nails. That means cut and clean. It's not saying multiple verbs. It's just replacing one verb, but we can put "do" in there and it replaces that verb, and we understand what it means. Is there something you have to do? Okay, I've killed that. Right? So why don't we go to "make"?

"Make". "Make" is create, when you create something. Creation comes from it didn't exist and now it does. You create. That's making. And when I say "create", there's a big difference between the two. Okay? Notice when we talked about "do" we talked about repetitive, obligation, multiple actions, dah-dah-dah-dah. It's a verb of action and so is "make", but the difference is this: When I talk about "do", you can't see it. Sorry, you can see it, but you can't touch it. You can see me washing, but you can't touch me washing the dishes. It doesn't make sense.</media:description>

<media:description>Do you have a hard time remembering what you read? Do you need to read things many times before you understand? Reading books can be discouraging because of the large amount of information on each page. To help you make sense of all that information, I will show you how to create a mind map. A mind map is a graphic that shows categories containing quick reference points from your book. By taking short notes and organizing them in a specific way, you will have all the information you need to quickly and easily remember the important points of a book. Just the process of thinking about and creating this mind map will help your brain to understand and remember the material. Try it! It really works and it is free. Mind maps are especially useful when it's time to write an assignment or study for an exam! Watch the video to learn how to create your own mind map.

TRANSCRIPT

How to submit. We want to hear from all artists and makers who have a passion for creating. That's cool. Hi. James from engVid. You notice? I was reading. It's not a special skill. Most of us learn it, but the problem is when you go to another language it's difficult sometimes to understand what's on the paper and be able to use that.

So today's lesson is about mind maps. Mind maps? Yeah. Wait a second, mind maps and reading. I did a general lesson earlier on. Somewhere in the link you can look down and you can find it, go back, you can watch it. But in that lesson I didn't give any specific examples on mind maps. I'm doing this particular lesson to address that. So, if you're here going: "Yeah, I want to learn about mind maps and reading", this is your lesson. Hold on two seconds. We're going to discuss what the benefits are, what the benefits of reading are, then I'm going to give you a very detailed mind map explaining what parts you should do for what, and that'll help you with reading. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

All right, E, what's up? "It's all Greek to me." Omega, it's not the best symbol, you probably can't see it, but Greek. In English we say when something's Greek to me, it means we don't understand it. A lot of times you'll get a big contract when, you know, you have your cellphone and there's a bill and it's: "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah", and you're like: "I don't understand it. It's all Greek." I know you understand all of the words, it's just they're put together in such a way it's difficult, and that doesn't matter if you're reading your own language or another language. But there are a lot of benefits when you're learning another language that reading gives you. And a lot of people want to talk and listen, but reading has some power. And let's address that now. Okay?

So mind maps are reading comprehension. Don't worry if you haven't seen the mind map, it's coming up in a second or two. But the first thing I want to talk to you about is reading helps you understand the way that the language is put together. Most of you will come and... You come to engVid to learn vocabulary and grammar, but that doesn't help you with syntax, that doesn't help you with putting the words together in a logical way. Reading does that because... Well, let's face facts, when you're reading someone is actually speaking to you but they're not in front of you. So the problem is if they're not very clear and they don't use the language well, you won't really understand them. Right? So reading teaches you how to... The language is put together, where the verbs go, and when's a better place to use the verb or a noun, and how you can show expressions. Okay?

Reading also teaches you how to speak by showing you the way that the language is used by the native speakers. Huh? Well, if it's a fiction book they actually say: "-'Johnny, are you coming?' -'Yes.' Dah, dah, dah, dah", and they show you how we use the language. So not only do you understand how to put the language together by looking at it and going: "Ah, comma here, period here", but then they say: "Hey, this is how we speak." So if you follow this you can actually use that kind of method or sys-... Not system. You can follow those words and actually speak like we do. All right?</media:description>

<media:description>You learn the most English if you're having fun doing it. So today, I'm going to teach you how to improve your English by watching movies and by listening to music! Many of you already listen to English music and watch shows and movies that are in English. I'm going to teach you some activities that will make you active with the language you hear. You'll also learn fun games you can play by yourself or with a friend that will help you learn vocabulary, expressions, and pronunciation. By learning English from movies and music, you'll also sound more like a native speaker.

TRANSCRIPT

To be, or not to be - that is the... Hi. James from engVid. Just practicing my Shakespeare. Well, not really. I just wanted to show you acting. Acting, being an actor can be a good way to learn English. And today I want to show you two fun ways to practice English doing things you already love to do. Okay? So, let's go to the board.

Mr. E is saying: "I sound like Madonna!" That's not here yet, but that'll be the second one, but today or right now this part of the lesson is about movies, acting. What we want you to do or what I want you to do is go find a movie you love in English. I'm sure there's... If you're watching me, I'm sure you've watched some English television program or movie. I mean, I'm speaking a lot of English so I know you're used to it. What I... What I want you to do is pretend you are an actor in a movie, and we're going to take a few steps to get there.

So the first thing is: Pick a movie that you love watching, because some of you watch it again and again. Star Wars, yeah, yeah? Or Harry Potter, if that's still out there, or Bond, James Bond. Right? Any of those movies. Okay, so you pick your movie. The second thing I want you to do is go through the movie and watch the scenes you love the best when the actor says something like: "Punk, do you feel lucky, punk? Well, do ya?" And then pick a couple of those scenes. All right?

The third thing I want you to do is go to this part, and it's i-m... It's www.imsdb.com. It's where you get scripts. Now, right now you're probably going: "What's a script?" Well, in music the words in the music are called lyrics. Okay? So when you're looking at the words in a song they're called the lyrics. But when you're looking at the words in a movie, it's from a script. And one actor has his part in a script, another actor has her part in a script. And these are the lines they say. This particular website has amazing amount... An amazing amount of movies with scripts, so you can go and find any of the latest ones, like of Jason Bourne, or I'm trying to think of something that came out. I don't know when you're going to see this, so just say Harry Potter, maybe Ironman. Okay? Go check it out, you'll see the scripts, you can go and look at it.

The reason why I asked you up here is to pick out scenes is you can go to the scene on the script where it may say: "Car chase scene", "Gun scene", "Kissing scene", and you can look at it, and all of the words the actors say are there. Because I know sometimes you don't know what the actor is actually saying. Sometimes we have what's called relaxed speech. In relaxed speech, they might say: "What do you want?" and it comes out: "Whatda ya want?" And you're like: "What?" It's English. Now, we have a video on relaxed speech, you can go and check it out, and it will explain: "Whatda ya want?" and other ones. Okay?

So, the lines that will be there, you might notice a big difference between what the actor says and what is actually written for what you should explain or you should understand. Okay? This is good, it's going to help you with your ears as well. There's a thing you can pick up from listening. Okay? So we want to look at the scripts and then listen.

Now, watch the movie at your favourite part. So now you've got the script in your hand, you're going to watch that part. Read. Here's the funny thing, a lot of times people read when they're watching a movie, like they read the subtitles-you know the little words?-and they think: "My listening is good because I understand." No, you're reading, but it does help because it helps you put a picture, a word picture to the words you're hearing. And we're much better with pictures. Think of it this way: Have you ever walked up to someone and said: "I remember your name, but I don't remember your face." No, you don't do that. We always remember faces and we forget names. Those kind of words and sounds are hard to remember, but the picture we always keep.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

God, I love your lips, Angelina. Hi. James from engVid. I was just thinking to myself: Well, I know it's very difficult to practice English because you don't get a lot of practice with English speakers, but if there were a way I could teach you how to get past "Hello" to make the conversation grow and perhaps have the other person come back and talk to you, that would be of great value. So this lesson is about how to get past "Hello" and make a beautiful conversation flow. All right? I'm going to use Angelina to help me later on when I do an example, but for now I will tell you more. See? He's like: "Tell me more. Hmm. I'm interested." And so am I. All right, so let's go to the board, shall we?

I'm going to give you five conversation openers. You've said: "Hello", where do you go? Personally I hate this because I teach and I hear people say: "Hello. My name is James. I am from Japan, Tokyo." The conversation is essentially dead. Dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh. Don't know if that's the wedding theme or the theme from Star Wars. Doesn't matter. You understand. It's killed. Nobody cares. You've said everything that they need to know and then they're done. So why don't we do something that actually gets them to open up and want to tell you information? Okay?

So the first one we're going to do is this one. I like this one. It's so easy, it's so true. Look for something that someone is wearing or has that you actually like. You're not going to steal it, so don't think about that. But what I mean is you like. You like the t-shirt, you like the jeans, the ear rings or something, you're like: "Cool", because that will be sincere. "Sincere" means that you really mean it and the person can feel that from you, so they'll want to share with you because you're being honest with them. All right? So we look here, number one, walk up and say... So it's like: "Hello. Love your __________ (jacket, t-shirt). That is so cool." Yeah? "Where did you get them?" or "Where did you get it?" Notice I didn't say: "Where did you buy it?" because some of the coolest things someone's going to be wearing won't be from this country. It might be: "Hey. I was in India and I picked up these beads. Yeah, it was really cool. I was outside this ashram and..." And now you've got a conversation you didn't even know. Or it might be: "Oh, I was downtown in the hippie section, you know, and it was really cool, there was all this art." You've started a conversation. If you say: -"...buy them?" -"At the gap." Finished. So: "Hey. Where did you get them?" Let them say "buy". Don't bring that up. Okay? Follow that up with right away... As soon as you say: "Where did you buy them...?" It's true... It might not be true right now, but it could be true, you say: "Because I really have to get a cool present", or: "...an interesting gift for my nephew/my brother/my sister/my friend." Right? Or girlfriend, whatever, or your wife. By saying that you're saying, well, one thing, you have other friends. But number two, you're giving them: "Cool". You're saying whatever they're wearing is interesting, cool, different enough that it stopped you to talk to them. By example or by extension, that means added on you're saying: "You're kind of cool, too, because you're wearing it and I think it's cool, so it's got to be cool and only a cool person would buy it." Right? This is why it works, you've given them two compliments. Who doesn't want to be complimented? First you're saying I'm wearing something cool, then you're saying: "I need to get something cool, and clearly what you have is cool." I'm probably going to talk to you and go: "Well, you know, thanks for saying that. I liked it because..." And conversation started, and now you have an opportunity to maybe later on talk more, and that's how you get your practice.

Number two, how about this one? "Wow, you are __________ (tall)" or: "You have __________ (really bright eyes)", or something that has to do with the physical body. The first one was about things. Physical. Now we want to talk about physical. And you followed that up with: "What do you do?" Huh? Example, you see someone, you go: "Wow, you have amazing skin. What do you do to make it so clear?" Okay? Hmm. Or: "Wow, you're tall. What do you do? Do you play sports or anything like that?" Okay? You follow it up. This is the follow up, as I said: "What do you do?" But why does this work? Now, notice this is green and I have green up here.</media:description>

In this video, I will give you some tips to organize your schedule and decide what you should work on. Whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or advanced speaker, you can always find something to improve on, and I will give you the tools you need to devise a good plan. Hint: it's more simple than you think! http://www.engvid.com/steps-to-learning-english-where-to-begin/

TRANSCRIPT

[Singing] Hi. James. Greer. James Greer. From engVid. [Laughs]. Not Bond, and I know you think I was going to say Bond. I know. But listen, Bond always has an important mission he's got to do, right? 007. And so do I. Today we have a mission. We're going to learn how to study English. I know in many places, many websites, they tell you, and to teach you grammar and idioms and phrasal verbs. But then, there's the big question of you, and: How do you study, and how do you choose what is important for you at this moment? Maybe you're advanced. Maybe you're a beginner. Maybe you know this, and maybe you don't. After today's lesson and we do our mission, you'll know exactly what you have to do. Okay? So, we're going to go to the board in a second, and take a look. What steps should we take in order to learn? By the time you're done this video, you'll know exactly... Or you should know where you are, where you need to go, and when you're going to be done. Ready? Let's go.

E. E is standing here saying: "Where do I start? Grammar, vocabulary, or speaking?" Common, and seems to make sense, I mean, you go to learn a language-right?-you go on a website, they start throwing things at you. You go to a school, they say you need this, this, and this. But you don't really know. So, I'm going to give you the tools to decide that.

First thing we're going to do is: What's the first thing you need? Grammar? No. What? Conversation? No. Vocabulary. What? Well, look. If you can't say: "bathroom" when you go to a country, you're going to pee yourself. Okay? "Hungry", you won't get food. You don't need to know everything to get basic information done. And that's what we should look at first. Basic information for a beginner really is vocabulary. And instead of all the fancy stuff you need, you don't need much. You need you, and a little bit of time, and to have some fun.

Why? I'm going to suggest: For basic communication, get vocabulary. I'm telling you right now if I see you or any English-speaking person sees you, and you see... You say: "Drink. Thirsty." There's no grammar, but they'll go: "Oh, the bar is over there." If you say: "Washroom. Please", they'll go: "Oh, toilet is over there." They use sentence, you use words. Sometimes you just touch your belly and go: "Ahh!" They'll go: "Oh, you want food." You don't need all that stuff. People will tell you you need to learn grammar, and this and that. You don't.

And here's how you get your first vocabulary. Do what you love to do. Play video games. I've had... I don't know how many students play video games, say they learned how to fire, duck, words that we wouldn't teach them for a while, because they were playing games. Other people come in: "Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, [sings]", singing. I go: -"What the hell?" -"I love to sing", and they sing a song, they sound like they're just, you know, from this country. Then they speak very terrible accent. You know what I'm saying, right? [Laughs] But when they sing, it's like the gods have come down. I mean, literally, you go: "Are you...? You were born here, right?"

Cool slang. You know? YOLO, you only live once. Right? ASAP, as soon as possible. When you do these things, you're learning because you want to learn. You're not even realising you're learning, and it's going to make you want to learn more because... You know, we'll get to the second one and you'll understand. But you want to communicate in a much better way. Okay?

So, get the meaning of basic words. "Hungry", "food", "toilet", "money". You know that one, right? You need those things. If you have those things, you can start your adventure in learning English. Okay? And you're going to do it by doing things you love. Video games, music, cool slang. Right? Come on. Now we're making language fun and easy for you, and that's what we should do, because you'll learn it faster. All right? And then here's the bad news: Hard work is on its way, so let's move over to the intermediate.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

When am I going to have time for sleep? Hi. James from engVid. New Orleans, it's a city of the United States. It's known for Mardi Gras in February. The town never sleeps. People are doing stuff all the time. And today's lesson is on, believe it or not, not New Orleans, but sleep. A lot of you guys, it's something... It's something we do, if you think about it. You're awake and one-third of your life is spent sleeping. And in your own language you have many words for "sleep", and we do, too. And some of these words I don't think you've ever been taught. If so, I'm going to try and help you remember them, and go through a couple phrasal verbs and good and bad words. So let's go to the board, shall we?

Sweet dreams are made of these. "Sweet dreams", what does that mean? It means... Depending. If I say to you: "Sweet dreams", I want you to dream, have a good night's sleep and dream or "sweet dreams", I'm having a good one. In this case, look at Mr. E. How are you...? Oh. He's fast asleep, so he can't hear me. But you'll notice he's sleeping, he's got some zzz' up here, and he's sweet dreams. Cake, ice cream, and engVid. Okay? If you think about our site, you'll have good dreams.

So let's start on the good side, shall we? Because that's where we should have a good night's sleep. Right? That's easy enough. "Good night's sleep", you sleep all the way through the night and you feel fantastic. If you have a little sleep, let's just say you've had a really busy day and you're a little bit tired. When I was a little boy we used to call it a "nap". So for 20 minutes or maybe 30, 40 minutes you'd go upstairs quietly, go into a little ball and go to sleep for 20 minutes and you'd take a nap. Well, now it's the 21st century and everything's more aggressive, so you don't have a nap, you have a "power nap". 20 minutes, total relaxation, total focus. So today it's gone from "nap" to a "power nap". And when you tell people you're having a power nap, you're going to sleep like a kitten and coming out like Batman. Okay? That's what they say now, so I'm power napping. It's a way of making it sound more important than: "I'm tired. I need to sleep." Okay?

Number two: "dream". A dream is basically pleasant thoughts while you're sleeping. That's what it is. You're travelling, having fun with your friends, kissing your favourite person. [Kisses] That's me. And that's a dream. You're having pleasant thoughts as you're sleeping. Okay?

What about "bedroom eyes"? If you like those movie stars and that, do you look in their eyes? Yes, and you go: "Oh my gosh, he's so sexy. He's so lovely. I love his eyes." Bedroom eyes are sexy eyes. People have bedroom eyes.

Now, there's another one for you: "Catch some zzz'" See up here? Mr. E is going: "[Snores]. Zzzzzz. [Snores] Zzzzzz." Catching zzz' is get some sleep. You'll often hear people say: "Man, I got to catch some zzz' before my airplane. I need to get some sleep." Why we pick "z", I don't know. Maybe it's the last letter of the alphabet and by the time you get there you're tired.

And finally let's talk about "pillow talk". What is "pillow talk"? Pillow talk. No, you don't go: "Yo, pillow, you are so sexy. Look at your bedroom eyes. You're beautiful." No. When we talk about "pillow talk" it's actually when you're in bed with your partner or lover, and you talk about things, intimate things like how you like their hair and their eyes, or what a good day you've had, and it's really kind of romantic, and it's quiet and it's nice, and then it ends in cuddling, which is another word for hugging in the bed and mmm. It's not necessarily sex. It's the nice thing after. Right? Sexual talk and cuddling, ladies, holding and touching after the big event. Yeah? Yeah. Tell your husband or your significant other person: "I like a little pillow talk when we're done, and we'll have it more often." Guys, listen carefully when you hear that one. Okay? Because your bedroom eyes won't always get you there.

That's the good, and I'm sure you're all smiling, going: "I like these. I get to nap, a little sleep. I get to have pleasant thoughts. I have... Use my eyes to make myself look much more attractive. I get to relax by getting some good sleep in there. And finally, if I talk and cuddle everything's good." Right?</media:description>

<media:description>How often do you study English? Daily? Weekly? Once a month? In this English grammar lesson, you'll learn how to express exactly how often something happens. You probably already know words like 'often', 'sometimes', and 'always' – those are indefinite adverbs of frequency, meaning they don't tell you exactly how often something happens. When we use DEFINITE adverbs of frequency, we express exactly how many times something happens in a time period. We use expressions like 'once a week', 'monthly', and 'annually'. In this lesson, I'll tell teach you the grammar and vocabulary of definite adverbs of frequency. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to understand and use these helpful adverbs in your spoken and written English.

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Yeah, baby. Hi. James from engVid. There's nothing I like more on a weekly basis than having my white wine with my yellow scarf around my neck. It's an interesting magazine. Got a director, Coppala, but I just don't see anybody who looks like me in this magazine, it's kind of funny.

Anyway, we got a lesson to do and that's what you're here for. I want to teach you about adverbs of frequency. And you're going to say: "James, I know adverbs of frequency. You've taught it, other people have." And I'm: "Yes I have, but not quite like this." You know, and it's good to revisit some things annually anyway. Right? [Laughs] I just used one.

Let's go to the board and take a look. All right. So, once a year, James speaks slowly. I'm going to introduce to you two different types of adverbs of frequency. Okay? Actually, yeah, two and then two small columns. Number one, there's the... The one you're used to: "always", "usually", "frequently", "never", and even how it breaks down. "Always" is 100%, "never" is 0%, and then in between we have stages of "often" is 70. You've seen this a million times, and you're probably pretty good at it. Right? You have to use it with the present tense verbs, yada, yada, yada, and it tells you how often something happens. These are the indefinite adverbs of frequency. What did you say? Indefinite, where did that come from?

Well, today we're going to learn about the definite adverbs of frequency because we'll either know the definite time or the number that something occurs. Ready? Let's go to the board. We started with a joke: "Once a year, James talks slowly." Well, you know it happens once a year. The problem with saying "rarely" or "occasionally", you know 5%, but not exactly. What does that mean in a month or a week? "One time" tells you exactly what it is. Right? All right.

So, one of the first things we have is: "Once", "twice" or "three times a week". You could say: "I go to the gym three times a week." I know... I don't maybe know the exact days, but I know exactly it's three times. It's better than saying "regularly", or in this case, "usually go" or "often go" because that doesn't tell me what the number is. It just says it's repeated a lot of times enough that it's sometimes. Okay? What does that mean, really, exactly? Nothing, really. But "three times" tells me something, especially if I want to get muscle, I need to go at least three times. Not: "I go sometimes." It's like: "Okay." Don't expect anything. All right? So, when we use the: "once", "twice", or "three times", we tell you how many times it's repeated within a timeframe. Sometimes we say "once" or "twice", we can say: "one time a week", "two times a week". Personally, I like "twice", I don't know why but I do. That's between you and I. But a lot of times people say: "twice" or "two times", and that's okay. It tells you how often to repeat it. All right? So we've talked about it. And if you will look carefully, and I want you to notice we talk about the number, then we have an article. The article makes it general. When we know in English: "a" is a general article that says generally speaking, versus "the", and a week, so in any week. Because it's a general week, it means in every or any week, this is how many times I repeat it. Cool? Yeah, you didn't know that. That little thing there has a meaning, and you just learned how to use it in another frame. Right?

Now, let's talk about the actual time periods. This is how many times I repeat it by number, but let's talk about time periods. And the time periods are simple. You already know them. Hours, days, weeks, months, and years. Except here, what we're going to use instead of years... And there is a word called "yearly", but it's really not used that much by most people. Instead, you hear "annually". Right? And I'm going to give you a couple of examples. Like, if you say... Well... I know I'm going to hear it from you, but we... You can say this and it's grammatically correct, but no, a lot of Canadians, and British people, and Americans don't walk around saying: "I go three times weekly to the gym."</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Why are you so angry all the time, E? You're like smash, relax. You're not the Incredible... Hi. James from engVid. E's turning green, and I know The Avengers are all over the planet, so I'm sure you know Hulk Smash. And the Incredible Hulk is powerful because he's angry, he's always angry. And the funny thing is I find most people are angry about this, angry about that. So I want to help you today do a little better, because when people are fighting, well, they're fighting because they care. If you didn't care, you wouldn't fight with anyone. And I have a two-part lesson... What I mean by two parts is I'm going to start off by giving you some expressions so you can kind of get rid of the fighting, and then I'm going to give you some vocabulary you can use instead of saying: "I'm angry. I'm angry. I'm so angry." There are other words that really let people know what you mean, and you can use some of these words and the phrases I'm going to teach you, and you'll notice that your interactions or the way you talk to each other will change and you'll probably be a lot happier, and not like E. E Smash, so angry, so angry. All right?

So let's go to the board. So what did I tell you here? Okay? I want us to stop the fighting. And how are we going to do that? Well, the first thing we have to do is accept that... Or accept that arguments and fighting are a part of life, and as I said, it's because you care. You fight because something is important to you, or someone is fighting with you because something is important to them. And when you don't take the time to understand it's important to them, that's what makes the fight worse. Half of the times things can be resolved or solved or fixed easily if you just go: "Hey, that bothers you? Got it." Once most people hear that, they're willing to talk to you. But if they don't think they're being heard, they smash, they hit hard.

So let's go to the board. Okay, so I'm going to give you two types of phrases. Okay? These will help you... One will help you let the other person know that you care and you're listening, the other one is so that you can express yourself. Okay? Because it's important that you have a voice and you should be heard. And then in the second part when we come back we'll do words that aren't always about being angry, but show different states and emotions, and I'll explain them and you can use them when you're ready. So, let's go.

Okay, these phrases, as it says, will help show that you care about the other person. And how do we show we care about the other person? Sometimes it's to say or to show that they're intelligent. Right? So the first statement I use as this: "You have a good point" or "That's a good point". In saying: "That's a good point"... I got to put a comma here, I just forgot my comma. "That's a good point", in saying that you're admitting that what they're saying, there's valid. Valid means has some truth. You're not automatically agreeing with everything they say, and that's important. When people are arguing, you don't have to agree with everything, but you have to listen and see what they say because sometimes what they say is good and can help both of you in your relationship. So simply just saying, you know: "You have a good point. I should think about this." Or: "That's a good point." Even if I don't agree with everything, I can still listen to you and hear that these are good points or these make sense. All right?

By using these phrases here, I just want to point out that it will help you because what you're saying really is: No matter what we fight about, at the end you're still my good friend, you're still my girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife, lover, student, or teacher. Okay? Not all together, by the way. But, you know, each one as a partnership, we're... We can still be good or have a good relationship even though we don't agree right now. Okay? So that's the first one.</media:description>

You'll also remember more of what you study, because you'll be making mental connections and learning in an interesting way. The secret is using 'word webs'. This powerful learning tool will change the way you learn vocabulary and idioms. In this video, I'll explain what a word web is, how to use it to learn English, and finally I'll do an example word web with you.

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from engVid. I would like to help you with your vocabulary. I'm sure that you've looked at engVid and seen many lessons on vocabulary, from drinking, vacationing, weddings, all sorts of things. But when you finish the video, how much do you remember? And how much do you really understand? I'm going to teach you today something I call the... A word web to help you not just remember the words, but truly understand them, and expand or go bigger than that. I did a lesson earlier on, on mind maps where I kind of introduced the idea of mind map, but I didn't really... I don't think I got into it as much that would actually show you how to use it so that you can get better with it. So, I'm going to fix that today. All right?

So what we're looking at is called a word web. And if you notice, poor Mr. E is caught up in the web. Nooooo! And I'm going to do the same with you. I'm going to get you... Because this is a spider, and the spider lives in a web, it catches things and those things can never escape. I want to do that with your memory and your vocabulary, teach you in a way that you're going to catch the words and you won't forget. Okay? So I'm going to explain the method here. So we're going to be clear on the method, then we're going to take a word and use it, and show you how it works. Ready? Let's go to the board.

All right, so, word web. This is a specific form of mind map which means it's one type. There are many types. Okay? And what they... What they do is they're based on the idea that your brain works a certain way with pictures and colours. So, why don't we use these to help you? And I'm going to do that now. What you will need, you will need a ax... You will need an English to English dictionary. If you really need to get, you know, your language to English, that's fine if you really need it, but English to English dictionary will be preferable because we want to get the definition of the word from an English source, not a translated source. Okay? So maybe we should start with your translating dictionary, and then after take the English word and get an English to English. The translating dictionary will help you understand the ideas, and then the English to English. And sometimes you might notice they don't exactly say the same thing. That'll be interesting for you.

Next, you're going to need access to the internet or an idioms dictionary. The idioms dictionary will be for later on, and they have them and you can even go online and look for idioms. But the joke of it is I said access to the internet. Well, my friend, if you're not on the internet, you're not watching this video, so I'm assuming you've got access to the internet. Okay.

The next four steps will be this: We're going to take a word... So, we're going to take one word, whatever the word is, we're going to write out the definition from the dictionary. What the dictionary says, not what you think, not an interpretation or somebody giving you sort of their idea of it. From that, we're going to follow... Okay? We're going to write out the words you think of when you see this word. This is called association. I think: "Cat", I say: "Dog". You say: "Milk", I say: "Cow". I associate. This is the words that come to me. I want you to do that because that is part of a natural human process. You think of something, you think of something else. You think of: "Mother", you think: "Love". You think: "Money", "McDonald's"? Probably not. But you get the idea. Okay? So we're going to start with the dictionary definition, then we're going to work with how your brain works. I want to have your mind incorporated or use your way of thinking in this. So you're going to put down your words. So if it was: "Cow", you might put: "Milk, cheese, and steak". Mmm, steak.

Then we're going to go out... Back to our dictionary, we're going to look for synonyms. If you open any dictionary usually it will say: "This is the word", and then it will have after it: "Here's a synonym for this word. Here's another one." Synonyms, you know, words that are similar. For instance, height and tall. How tall is the building? What is the building's height? They're not exactly the same, but they can be used in a similar or same fashion sometimes. Okay?</media:description>

<media:description>You may have been following the political debates in the news these days, and maybe some of it didn't make much sense to you. Politics is often a difficult topic to talk about because people have very different ideas of what is good and bad, and many terms are misunderstood or misused. In this lesson, I will make sense of political vocabulary, so that you can start understanding the news, and have conversations that make sense. In particular, I will focus on the tems "left wing" and "right wing". You'll hear these often, and it's important that you understand where these terms come from and what they mean exactly. No matter what you believe, it's not as simple as good and evil! Beware: not everyone will agree with you, so keep an open mind and discuss your ideas politely. Politics can be fun and interesting if you keep this in mind!

TRANSCRIPT

I left my heart in San Francis-... Hi. James from engVid. I'd like to do a lesson today with you on politics. I know, you're used to grammar and vocabulary, but it's always good to expand your horizons, that means your learning abilities and look at things that you may not need today but you will need in the future, especially when you have, you know, educated conversations. In your own languages you often speak about religion, politics, sexual relations, and in this lesson what I want to teach you is a way to understand English terms, what they mean to us when we hear them and what we're trying to tell you when we're saying them. That way you can get into political conversations, and that doesn't mean, you know, who's right, who's wrong, but be able to explain where you're from, what it's like, and where we're from and maybe understand each other a little better. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

I said I left my heart in San Francisco. There's a reason for it. Notice E says: "I'm a lefty." Quick story for you so you understand. A long time ago back in England there were two houses. There's the queen, I'm sure you probably know that England has a queen, and they let the common people vote and there would be one side where the people with title, or princes, and counts, and dukes would sit; another side where the common people would sit. I'm wondering if you can figure out which side which sat. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, I know, difficult. Let me explain. So if you were the king or queen you sat in the middle, and you'd have your nobles, that's your knights, your kings, your dukes, your princes, barons; on the other side the common people. Well, I'll let you know. This is my right side. On the right side the barons, and the kings, and the dukes would sit; on the left side would be the common people. After a while what happened was people started referring to people on politics as right and left. Why? Because on the right side, the nobles, the kings, the princes, they wanted things to stay the same. They liked what they had, they didn't want to have anything to change. Of course, the common people who are on the left side, they were the ones who had money and they were paying for things and not really seeing things change, and they were like: "Hey, if we're paying, we should get to change things." So this became known as "left wing" and "right wing" because it was in the house of politics where the king would sit, there was a left side and a right side. Today's lesson is going to explain to you what that old way of thinking has changed into in the modern day, and where we sit now. You ready? Let's go to the board.

Okay. You see this thing here? It's called a pendulum. A pendulum is basically you can have a string with a rock, and once you move it, it goes back and forward, back and forward, and swings. Politics, which is the business of people being together, "polis" meaning people. That's what it means. Politics. The people choose, and often sometimes they change in the way they look at things. Center is when the pendulum isn't moving. Center. And as you can think, it's probably a nice place to be. But there's more movement or activity when the pendulum goes up to the right or up to the left. That's when we see a lot of changes. And it's good to understand what terms are used and how they affect us.

So let's start with... Well, let's start with the left, the common people. All right? Most of you would know the extreme version if you've heard of it... Or let's go here first. When we talk about left, we talk about all for one and one for all. If you're French, it's the three musketeers. One for one and one for all.</media:description>

<media:description>Even native English speakers make mistakes! In this video, you'll learn five mistakes English speakers make that you should avoid. We'll look at spelling, pronunciation, confused meanings, bad grammar, slang, and words that don't exist! It's okay to make mistakes, and when you're learning a language,  you're going to make some. My goal in this lesson is to get rid of some common mistakes, so that you can sound smarter and be more confident with your English. Once you know these five mistakes, watch this other video on five other common native speaker mistakes: https://youtu.be/75CP1xyoNFo

TRANSCRIPT

"Swept up like a douche on the..." Uh, douche. Deuce, deuce, deuce. Hi. James from engVid. I just made a mistake in singing that song. I used the wrong words or lyrics. It happens all the time. People do it when they speak. And native speakers make certain mistakes that we don't think of as mistakes, and sometimes even teachers, like myself, will do it. So, this particular lesson is how to not make the mistakes that we make, and we don't even know we're making them. I want to help you speak like a native speaker, but not make the same mistakes they do. Okay? So, we're going to look at five different word pairs that are confused in English. But at the end of this lesson, you won't be confused, and in fact, you should understand English a little bit better. Are you ready? Let's go to the board. Okay. "Swept up like a douche", what was I thinking? Are you ready?

So, look, Mr. E's saying: "We all make mistakes!" And what mistakes does he want to point out today? Let's take a look. "Literally" versus "figuratively". "I literally fell down the stairs. Well, figuratively speaking, I fell down the stairs." For you, it doesn't make a difference, but there's a huge difference. "Literally" in English means it actually happened. What I'm talking about happened. So, I literally got punched in the face. I got punched, literally, you can see it. But if it didn't happen, maybe somebody said something to you that you didn't like and you said: "It felt like I got punched in the stomach, like I was literally punched." Well, no, they said something you didn't like, that's figuratively. So you could say: "Figuratively speaking" or "Figuratively put, it felt like I got punched in the stomach." "Literally" means it has to happen, "figuratively" is a metaphor. It's a way of using language to let someone know how you feel in a graphic way. Okay? So, you're giving them something to feel with or work with, because it didn't happen, but you can't really explain how it felt. A punch in the stomach really hurts. Well, words don't physically hurt you, but we all know what it's... Well, maybe. We know what it's like to get hit in the stomach, it's not comfortable, so we understand what they're saying. Right? Cool.

How about the next one? "Could have", "could of". Huh? Well, here's the deal: It's more about stress than anything else. This is something that we don't pay attention to, because as English speakers, we know: "I could have done that", it's really a stress of the "v" from the "have". Right? "Could have", because we contract the word to: "could", and it looks like this, we get rid of this and do that, and it becomes: "could've". But because we say "v" and we stress that, people who are non-native think we're saying "could of". Now, it's not really noticeable when they speak or we speak, because, you know, you can't see words when I am talking. The problem comes when you write. An English speaker will write: "I could have done this", and they will write either: "could have" or they'll write "could": "could've", like this. But unfortunately, non-native speakers will actually write it with "of" because they're confused by the words. Right? So this is a mistake more for writing, but be careful. Okay? You can have the same thing with: "could of", "should of", "would of", the o-f. Okay? Cool. So that's number two.

Let's look at number three, another mistake that native people make sometimes, and you might make more often. "Who" versus "that". This is a simple one. "Who" is used for people. "Do you know the guy who lives next door?", "who" because "who" is a person. Easy enough. "That" is used for things. "Do you know the machine that sits on top of my counter?" Because it's not a person, it's a thing. And usually you remember this when we talk about: "Do you want this or do you want that?" You don't refer to people with "this" or "that", generally speaking. Okay? But sometimes...

Notice that I made a mistake. Huh? I'm going to go here. I made a little mistake. Sorry, guys. "Noticeable", now that is much more noticeable, so don't make my mistake. See? We all make mistakes.

Anyway, "who" versus "that". Now, when I said "that" with a machine: "Do you know that machine on my desk?" it's for things. Right? You wouldn't say: "Do you know the machine who sits on my desk?"</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Hello, I'm David Beckham. No, I'm not. I'm James. This is engVid. This is David Beckham. But you might be thinking right now some interesting questions, as to: Why did I say I was David Beckham instead of James as normal? Well, I wanted to get your attention, I wanted to start a conversation. And a lot of times we do this through asking questions. This lesson is about how to change your questions, because many people learning English like to ask questions with the answer "Yes" and "No", and frankly, it's quite boring. It puts me to sleep. Okay? So I'm going to teach you in this lesson how to use W5 questions in order to make a conversation much more interesting, to learn more about the person, and they can learn about you. And when I'm done with you, you're going to be an excellent conversationalist. That's a person who is good at making people like them. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

Here's E. "Boring. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yes and no." Do you think the weather is nice? Yes/no. Do you like your food? Yes/no. Blah, blah, blah. These lead to questions in which people answer "Yes", and you are forced to continually ask questions, and it sounds more like you're being interviewed, like a police interview: -"Where were you at last dah-dah-dah?" -"Oh my gosh!" And then there's these colourful ones. See these nice little balls, all happy and nice? These are W5 questions, because not only are you asking a question, you're asking about me and asking for my opinion and I want to give it to you, which means I'll talk to you longer and you'll get the opportunity to become a better listener and speaker. All right? Let's go to the board.

Okay, first things first: "W5 Questions for More Interesting Conversations". What is W5? Because I've said it about five times, and some of you will know right off, and some of you are going: "I don't understand." W5 are information questions. They... These are the things that we use in English to get information, so you cannot say "Yes" or "No" to these things, you actually have to explain. And by explaining, you give more information which makes it much more interesting for me, the listener, and for you, as the speaker, because you get to explain yourself.

W5, we start off with: "Who?" These are the people. Who are you speaking to? Who are you speaking about? People and persons. Okay? "When?" This is the time. What time did it happen? 12 o'clock, February, 2001. September 11th, ring a bell, anyone? Makes a difference. Okay? "Where?" This is the location. Where did it take place? In my house, at work, in Ireland, in Jamaica, in Japan. "Where?" changes everything. Right? "Why?" What is the reason that we're having this conversation? Why did you do it? People have reasons, and if you ask them, it's amazing what they'll tell you. Most of the times we look for "Yes" or "No" because we want information, but the reason behind somebody did it might explain why the "Yes" or the "No" much clearer to you, and sometimes to them, actually. And: "What?" What are we talking about? What is the subject of the conversation? It's not always about people. It could be about money, health, politics. "What?" is important to us. All right? The subject of the conversation.

And here's one in orange, because it's not really "W"; w, w, w, w. Maybe at the end, but: "How?" "How?" is really useful. I put there is W5, because it's the method. How did you get there? Like, tell me the steps that you got there. Not your reason, but the way that you did it. Okay? So, why did I go to Japan? Because I love the country, I love the people. How did I get there? By airplane, and then by boat because I wanted to go to Okinawa. That changes the story. Okay?

So, if we put these together... And you're going to ask in a second: "What do you mean?" because I've told you we're going to be great conversationalists, we'll go through a sample conversation in a second. Here's this. Okay? These are often used in English writing. That's why I'm giving it to you now, because we use it in writing because, in writing, you're speaking when you write, but there's... You don't know your audience. So, a lot of people use these things in their writing to actually get to know who their audience is and maybe make it much more interesting for a person that they don't know who's going to read their work later on.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT 

"Every man has the potential (and woman) for a great..." Hi. James from engVid. Just let me finish. I'm going to take a quick swig. [Gulps] Oh, good. [Laughs] I want to talk about drinks. I should talk about drinks. This coffee smells amazing. One more sip. I said "swig" and "sip", and you're probably thinking they're the same, but if you notice what I did when I took a swig: [Gulps], when I took a sip, maybe a taste. What? They're different; not the same. And if you ever take a swig of my beer when I offer you a sip, I won't be happy.

Let's go to the board and find out: What the heck did I just say? Okay? What the hell, talk about drinks. E drank too much. Yup, yup, yup, he did. He should have just sipped his beer, he would have been okay. I have some drawings on the board, and what we're going to do is go through drink: When we drink, what do we say? What is the difference when we use these words? And how you should use them so you can sound like a native. Right?

If you look over here, it says: "eat". There is a video, go check it out, and it has all the words for "eat" and how we went from little eating, like "nibble", to a lot, like "gorge", and that was there. It's going to be done in the same way. And if you noticed, when you looked here, there were a few words. And I've added a couple. You're going to say: "Wow, I didn't see these words before." And you're right, the words you didn't see were: "guzzle", "choke", and "consume". These are three new words. But when you drink or eat, we will use these words as well. Right? We talked about the Venn diagram showing words that are different and words that are similar to both.

In this case, "guzzle", if I'm guzzling my coffee... I won't now because it's hot, but I'd be like: "[Gulps]", because maybe I have to go somewhere. It means to drink greedily. So, like an animal, drink greedily or quickly. "Choke" is this: "[Coughs and chokes]". You can guzzle down food, you can choke on food, you can do the same with liquids. If I'm eating a sandwich and I choke. But I can choke by drinking the liquid. We say: "Goes the wrong way", and you're like: "So, how are you doing Mr....? [Coughs and chokes]. I'm choking." "Choke".

"Consume" is a word that means to eat or drink or use up. I put this word specifically because you'll hear it when people talk about buying things, they're consuming. It means they're using it up. When you eat or drink, guess what? You're using it up. If you look carefully, there's no coffee because I've consumed it. So if someone said he consumed a lot of alcohol, or meat, or something, it means they used it up or finished it - "to consume". Cool? Glad you like it, because now it's time to talk about the words.

So, where are we? A "little". A "little" is a taste. Imagine your tongue. All right? Rolling Stones, don't sue me. Okay? When you taste something, it's just like putting just a small amount here. "Ah, I like that." Because sometimes you see somebody drinking a blue drink with a green thing on top. You don't want to drink that, but it looks interesting, so you might want to taste. And you will go like this: "Mmm" or "Ugh". "Can I have a taste?" If someone says: "Can I have a taste?" or "Do you want to taste it?" you should take a lot. Just a little bit to put on your tongue and get a taste of it. Please don't put your finger in my drink to taste it. Put your tongue. Okay? So you can see this one is a taste. Okay?

Bang. That's right. Bang on the head, we got to do the next one. What is a "sip"? I'm a nice guy and I'm sure you're a nice guy, so your friend comes and he goes: "Hey, man, you're drinking a beer. Can I have a sip?" A "sip" is a little drink. See the ant? Imagine an ant drinking. It's not going to drink a whole cup of coffee. It's going to have a sip. That means you're allowed to do this and stop. I can repeat. Ready? There we go. Stop. If you're still going like a plane, we have a problem. I won't be happy. A sip means this. But here's something to help you really remember.</media:description>

<media:description>Religion and beliefs are an important part of our lives, but talking about them can be difficult. If you're not careful, you might offend someone or even get into trouble. In this video, I'll teach you how to discuss religion politely so you can have respectful conversations in English and learn about other cultures. You'll learn vocabulary related to major religions and beliefs so you can discuss popular faiths intelligently. Most importantly, I'll teach you how to use open-ended questions that will help you develop conversations with people who have different beliefs. I'll talk about Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and others while discussing how people can identify as being religious, spiritual, orthodox, or non-practicing. I'll also explain the difference between of atheists and agnostics. The world is full of many cultures and beliefs. We all have so much to learn from each other, so take your English conversations to the next level by learning to discuss religion. 
Test your understanding of the lesson by taking the quiz: http://www.engvid.com/how-to-have-a-conversation-about-religion-in-english/

TRANSCRIPT

You are healed. You are...Hi, James from engVid. When I'm not actually teaching English, sometimes I do religious services. I'm joking, but this is a serious matter. By the end of this video, I would like to make sure that when you speak to people of different religious faiths or backgrounds, you will be able to, when you will remember that...Well, how to talk about religion, or faith, or belief. Okay? Sometimes we talk about religion, and sometimes we can say "faith" or "belief" and it means to believe in a higher power; it could be God, it could be a Spirit, whatever moves you. I think it's kind of a serious lesson, because religion is a very powerful force in our lives, and we should be respectful of one another or to each other when we discuss it. You can't have an open dialogue if you have a closed mind. "Dialogue" means to talk, okay? So, this lesson is to help you be able to speak to someone else who doesn't believe the same way you do, so at least you understand each other. Listen to me carefully: You don't have to always agree or like, but you can respect and understand, and that's today's lesson.

So, ready to get serious? Let's go to the board, shall we? Okay. So, you'll notice I have different symbols up here. I am a terrible drawer. I can't do anything. The worm is as good... Sorry, E. Mr. E is as good as I get, so this is as good as you're going to get. So if you go: "My faith is not there. I'm Bahai." I'm like:
"You're behind me, because I don't know how to draw it. Sorry." So, here are some of the world's major religions that have billions of people that follow, or hundreds of millions. So I tried my best. Forgiveness if I didn't get it quite right. Okay? Nobody get upset. I did a bad drawing for all of you. Let's go to the board. One of the most common questions people say when they talk about religion, they meet you and go: "Hi. My name is James. I'm from Canada. I teach English. Do you believe in God?" And that's the problem right there. "Do you believe in God?" You're going: "What's the problem? It's a question." Yeah, but it's a yes/no  question. Please check out the other videos I have on making interesting conversation, because especially in this one, when you say yes or no, you really limit the
person, or we say put them in a corner. You put me in a place where I'm with you or against you. Already we have division or friction. So why don't we ask a question that lets them speak to us, and explain to them where we're coming from so that we can get a mutual understanding? Now we understand together. And I think I've got two questions that can help you make friends from different faiths, so you understand each other and start that dialogue. Remember? Talking. If you say: 
"Are you a person of faith?" you're not... They can say yes or no, but you're actually not saying "God". Remember I said "faith" or "belief"? "Belief" means to think something is real. "Faith" means to believe something... Believe in something. And when you're thinking of that, I don't necessarily have to think of God. I could think of a force that makes the world go around. Gaia. Some people believe in Gaia. Life... The Earth is alive and we're part of the Earth. That's a belief, it's a faith. Some people believe... Have... Well, you don't have a belief in science. You could say it's a belief, but they believe in science. Right? And that has nothing to do with God. So when people say: "Do you believe in God?" They're really saying: "There are those who believe in God, and the blasphemers and the heathens", and it doesn't have to be like that. Some people don't believe in the book, but they actually believe in the same God you do. So, give them a break. Okay? And ask: "Hey, are you a person of faith?" And they might say: "Yes, I do believe in a higher power." Okay?</media:description>

<media:description>Today I'm going to show you the money! You're going to learn useful phrasal verbs we use in English to talk about money. Most of us love having money and hate spending it. Regardless of how you feel, money plays an important role in all our lives. I chose to teach you some of the most common phrasal verbs we use to talk about saving money, spending money, paying off debt, and using your savings. You'll learn how to speak naturally about money by using these expressions. Know it all? Test yourself with the quiz at:

TRANSCRIPT

Money, money, money is so funny in a rich man's world. Vanity Fair. I'm not a rich man, so I can't afford half of the things in here. Speaking of which, we're talking about money, and in this lesson what I want to do is teach you a bunch of phrasal verbs that we use to talk about spending money, saving money, and paying back debts that we use quite commonly. And I'm going to teach you how to use them, and what they are, and have some fun with you. Are you ready? Let's go to the board. Okay?

E, it's not funny, I got no money. E is all, see? Got dollar signs for eyes. You might see that. If you're having a problem, take your screen and enlarge it to full screen, there's a little button. And we actually have a video on that, go check that out if you don't know how to use your YouTube. Okay? Anyway, E's got his eyes... He's got dollar signs for eyes, because he's got money in his hand. And if you're lucky, you have money, too; but when you don't have money, well, it's time to learn some phrases to help you with that. Okay?

So, here's our dollar sign, here, and let's start with having money or saving it. Okay? If you're lucky... Well, let's start with just having enough. A lot of people just have enough money. And how do we talk about that in English? Well, what you can say is this: "I'm getting by". "Getting by" means I don't have a lot of money, and I'm surviving. So I can't go on big trips or do anything, but I'm not poor and I don't have zero money, but I have enough to get my food, and pay my rent or my homestay, and pay some other things for me, maybe my cellphone and my internet, but nothing special; no car, no fancy trips, no bling, bling, bling or great jewellery. You know what I mean? So, that's "getting by". It's kind of positive because it means I'm not bad, but it's not fantastic, like: "I'm rich!" Okay?

Let's talk about "scrape by", because this is have just enough. When you're scraping by, imagine you have this thing here-okay?-and this thing. And there's gum on here, and you want to get the gum off, you're going to... That's called scraping. And when you scrape, sometimes you'll take a little bit of the paper off with it, just a little bit, when you scrape. In Canada, we have winter, and when we have ice on our windows, we scrape the ice to get rid of it. It's a lot of work, it's not lots of fun. You probably understand the phrasal verb now, right? When you're scraping by, you just have enough money. But unlike "getting by", because notice how we have "get", we have you're getting something, you're given something, which is good, you're getting money, that's why you get by; 'scraping" by means just a little bit. Just enough. And you feel negative. You don't feel good when you're scraping by. Every day is heavy and hard, because you almost don't have enough money to pay for everything. Sorry. You need a job or a better one. Okay.

So, what happens? How do we change this, "scraping by"? Why don't we do something like this, why don't we save some money? In English, we have two phrasal verbs you can use for saving money. Notice the up sign: "to save up". When you save up money... Think of it this way: Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. You increase your money. You usually save your money up for something big, like a car, a vacation, retirement. And retirement is when you stop working forever. You're older, 65-70, you finish work and you don't want to work again, you want to play golf, or go baseball, go sailing. You retire. So, you save up. These are for big purchases. So, it won't be $100. It'll be $1,000, $10,000, a million dollars. A million dollars. [Laughs] Okay.

We have another one for saving, though, and we call it: "put aside". You might have difficulty because probably you've never heard of "aside". This is my side, this is on the other side. Okay? So when we say "aside", it's like here, on the side. On the side is "aside". Okay? Sometimes we speak and say: "I want to make an aside", which means I'm going to give you a direct conversation, but I want to say something a little off to the side.</media:description>

<media:description>Learning a new language is difficult and boring. Every student learns differently, and it's important to find a study method that is right for YOU. I want to put the fun back into studying English with two methods that are fun and which make learning easier and quicker! In this lesson, I will teach you how to make connections between words in order to remember them more easily. I will also reveal my hidden poet talents, so you don't want to miss this one!

TRANSCRIPT

Yeah, that was fun. I'm looking forward to hearing that from you later. Hi. James from engVid. In this video what I would like to do is help you work on vocabulary. I want to make it fun, because when things are fun, you work harder and you learn more. And today's lesson, I'm going to teach you two ways to not only just remember vocabulary, but learn how to use vocabulary in a way that we use it, and you will really understand it, and... Heck, it's fun. You're just going to have fun doing it. I'm sure you will. All right? It's a little bit creative. So, let's go to the board. Simple lesson. Here we go.

Two ways to have fun with language. Not just language, but vocabulary. Ways that you may not be studying in class, we're going to do here today. The first one I want to talk to you about is fill in the gap. Huh? "A gap" means a space, there's a space between something. So, here's my hands, in between my hands is a gap. Okay? You have a gap between your eyes. One eye, one eye, space. In this case, you see I've got this: "tree __________ chair". Now, fill in the gap doesn't mean just one word. It's a couple of ways you can do this. In this particular game, we're going to take two vocabulary words, "tree", and take another one, "chair", and they're kind of a little obvious to make it easy for you, but what I want you to do is one of two things.

The first thing we can do is use x words. What I mean by that is you could say: "I want to use five words, and I want to go from 'tree' to 'chair'." Or: "I want to use three words from 'tree' to 'chair'" or two. Huh? Well, okay. How do I get from "tree"? Okay. "Tree", "cut". You cut the tree down, right? "Lumber". Lumber you make into wood you can use. Let's see. "Carpenter". Find a carpenter. "Craft". "Craft" means make. You're like: "What?" These... All these words... And then I can say: "Furniture". Okay? Okay, furniture. "Chair", so if I have a tree, I cut it down and make it into lumber, I take it to a carpenter, he crafts it into a chair. Five words from A to B. So, one game is tell yourself: "I want to go from five... One word to another word, and I want five words to get there."

And you can challenge yourself; maybe go from three words. Right? Or make 10 words. You can use it to describe something. How many words you can use to describe a certain thing. Right? "I have this word, and I want to go to this word. How many words does it take me to get there?" What this does is it teaches you relationship between words, and that also can teach you nouns and verbs, and how they function together. Or, we say "syntax", right? So, start at A, say: "I want to use five words to get there." This is a great word to do with a friend. You can say: "Okay, we're going to do 'tree' and 'chair', you need to do five words that make sense to go from 'tree' to 'chair'", and put a clock on for five minutes. You go, and she goes, you write together and see what words you get. Compare, check them out. "Why did you choose this, and why does this word...? What does this word mean?" Right? So, now, you're not just writing words in a book and saying: "This word means this." You're: "What does it mean? How do I use it? How would other people use it? How would other people think?" Right? Yeah. See? That's fun by yourself or with a friend.

Okay, listen, the second way to play this game is: How many words to the answer? What? Well, we can pick up two random words, two, like... I have "chair"... "Tree" and "chair", we could have put "chair" and "moon". Now the game gets a little bit more interesting. Right? "Chair" and "moon". How many words does it get me to go from "chair" to "moon"? Now, you might say: "That's impossible. They have nothing to do with each other." I could say, "Listen, the chair in my living room"-"living room" is a noun-"sits"-which is a verb-"close to the big bay window where I can see the moon at night." How many words did it take me to get from "chair" to "moon"? So, it's playing with words, being creative.</media:description>

<media:description>Eating and drinking are things we do every single day, but the vocabulary available to talk about them is much richer than the obvious words we use on a regular basis. In this English vocabulary lesson, you will learn different ways to express eating and drinking in creative ways. How would you tell someone you wanted more than a snack but less than a meal? Do you know the difference between "wolfing down", "devouring", and "scarfing down" food? Watch the video to find out, and make sure to do the quiz afterwards to practice what you learned!

TRANSCRIPT

Mm, mm, eating. New Orleans is a gourmand's dream. Oh, and I'm so hungr-...

Hi. James from engVid. I'm hungry, and I'm thinking about eating, and I'm sure you do, too. After all, eating is a natural thing. But in your experience of what you've been taught, I'm sure you've been told words like: "delicious", "eating", and that's about it. Hey, the world's a big place and a rich place, so why don't we give you a rich vocabulary and give you, you know, some native-speaker speak on eating. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

So, I'm looking at a book. I'll say... Oh, what's this? "Time to pig out, Mr. E? It's not time to scarf down pizza and beer. We've got work to do." I'm sure you're going: "Scarf? Why 'scarf'?" We'll find out. On the board, we have: "How to talk about eating". Simple enough. Chew, swallow. No, not so simple. Like, in every country, there's a way to speak about things, and I want to give you a good... Good introduction to our eating lexicon, which is dictionary. We're going to go from a little to a lot. And I'll give you the words that we might use, and explain each one, and you'll notice there are some pictures here, so I will give you the number with each picture. Some won't have pictures, but hey, that's life. Suck it up, baby.

So the first one: "nibble". I want you to imagine a mouse. [Nibbles] Do mice eat a lot? No. They eat a little bit, just a little food. Okay? Now, "nibble" can be a noun as in the amount of food you eat, or verb, and it means to eat just a little bit. Okay? And that's our first one. "Nibble". Think of a mouse. A mouse nibbles its food; has a little bit of food.

"Graze" is number two. "Grazing" is funny. You kind of eat a lot, but you don't. Huh? Well, when you graze, think of cows. You see the cow: "Moo", it's moving through, [eating noises]; moves over here, [eating noises] moves over here. It eats a little bit of everything, or as I like to say, when I go to people's houses and I don't know if the food is good, I just graze. I try a little, [eating noises], and I move on. Try a little, I move on. I might stay in a place where I like that. Okay? Cows graze. Funny enough, men don't really graze. Women graze more than men. They do it because they eat, they go: "I'm having fun, I'm enjoying myself. I'm going to try this, this, this, this, this." Men just want to, boom, gulp it down. So, to graze is to move and eat a little bit of food at a time. We usually do this at buffets or with foods we're not sure of, like, I'm just going to graze a bit. Okay? You see the cow? That's Bessie, graze. So, when you see people eating a little bit of food, and moving around, and keep coming back to the same food - they're grazing. Not really eating.

Numero uno. Uno? Did I say "uno"? See, I don't speak Spanish. That's why I shouldn't. Number three: "bite". You know a bite as, here? Yeah. Easy. Right. Oh, sorry, I should say "graze" is a verb before I forget, there. "Graze", a verb. "Bite", a bite. Now, notice a bite is singular in this case. "A bite" is interesting because it's a medium amount of food, and it's a noun. When you go for a bite, you want some food. When we talk about "nibble", I said cheese, I should have actually said: "Think nibbling as on peanuts, chips maybe, a cookie or two". I just want to nibble; not a lot of food. Remember the noun? When you go for a bite to eat, you want something like a hot dog. You go: "Okay, I get it." No, no, you don't get it. I want just a hot dog, or I want a slice of pizza, or I want a hamburger, but I don't want a salad, I don't want dessert, I just want something more than a nibble, more than chips, but not a full meal. I'm not... I don't have the time or I'm not that hungry. So when you go for a bite, some people might go... They won't even go for a doughnut, like a doughnut would be something to nibble on or just eat, but a bite would be a hamburger, hot dog, something like that. Big, but not too big, because it's a medium amount of food. All right? So, I'm going to go for a bite. And look here, there's a mouth. There you go. "Bite". Don't forget to get a bite. Okay? I might even say as an idiom: "I'm going out for a bite. Do you want something?" If you go: "Yeah, give me a salad, plus this", I go: "Dude, I'm going for a bite. You want a meal, go by yourself. That's way too much food."</media:description>

<media:description>English for Beginners: Prepositions are short words that help us express location, time, and other relationships between people and things. Some examples of prepositions are: on, at, in, and by. Do you know how to use them? For example, do we say, "I am on a taxi" or "in a taxi"? Do you like to travel "in a plane" or "by plane"? After watching this simple but useful lesson, you will know exactly which preposition to use in any situation.

TRANSCRIPT

I'm having a hard time reading on the train right now. Unh. Hold on. I'll start the lesson.

Hi. James from engVid. Sorry, I was on the train. I want to teach you a lesson about four basic prepositions that we use in English that sometimes get confused, and I understand why, so I'll keep it basic. But because it's basic, it's going to be 80% correct. That's a good thing, that means you can go to the website and learn more from other lessons we have. But just know that sometimes there'll be exceptions, and I may not cover it here today. I'll even give you two exceptions to help you, but why waste time? Let's go to the board.

Here's Mr. E. You'll notice he has a calendar, he has a clock, and: "You are here"? Oh, here. "Here" is a location. We're here right now, doing a lesson. That's the location: engVid. Let's go to the board and do the rest of the lesson, shall we?

Here's: "at", "on", "in", and "by". "At". I love it because it's very specific, so you always know where you are, exactly. Problem: For transportation, "at" doesn't have anything. Hmm. So let's go to the next one. Let's go to "on". On. "On" is used for, let's say, large vehicles or large ways of travelling, such as buses... Sorry. Trains, buses, planes, and boats. I'll come back to boat in a second; it's an exception. On the train, on the bus, and on the plane, unless you're Bill Gates, Donald Trump, or me-I'm not in that list-you don't have your own train, plane, or bus, so you usually share it with a bunch of people or a few people. It's large. So we say: "You're on the bus", because it covers a big area, so there are many people sitting in that area. When I get to location, you'll see what I mean.

Boat is a small exception. For many people in the world, they have their own boats because maybe they do fishing, or rowing, which is a type of boat that you go by yourself. In that situation, you can use "in". So, if the boat is small enough, say: "in": "I'm in a boat right now." But if it's a big boat, you have to say: "I'm on a boat." Another exception for the "on" rule is bicycle. You're always "on" a bicycle. I know, I said big vehicles, but remember: a bicycle is small, and it doesn't really have a motor or an engine, so we kind of give it its own thing, because you have to sit on the bicycle, and you can never really be in a bicycle. Is that good?

Now, let's go to "in". "In" is funny because there are only two things for "in". "In" we use for car and taxi. The easy way to think about it is usually you own your own car; it doesn't belong to a group of people. People just don't get on your car every time you stop it, they go in and say: "Take me somewhere." And a taxi, well, when you're in a taxi, it is kind of your car. You pay the driver and you keep the car. So, this is one of those few cases where, because it belongs to me, I am in my car or I am in the taxi, because the taxi belongs to me as long as I pay the money. It's one of these funny exceptions. I don't know why, because you can put more people in a car, but I guess because you can actually own this transportation, it's yours. Think of it like the small boat. The small boat, one person is in it, you can be inside of it. All right? Cool.

The last one we're going to do is "by". This is how you get there. So, "by" is different. When we talk about "in" and "on", you are... We are talking about how you are in the vehicle. Are you sitting on the bicycle? I can see you on it? You know, a boat is on water. But "by" just means: How did you get here? So, when someone responds to you with: "By car", "by plane", they're telling you how they got here. Not if they're in the plane, or on the plane. They are just... That's how they got there. So, how did I get here to do this video? Wouldn't you like to know. I'm kidding. I came here by car. So, yes, I was in my car and drove here, but I would tell somebody: "I got here by car, not by bus", and that would tell them the difference in the transportation I took. "How did you get here?" You like that? Good, so that's "by", this is how you did it; and the way you travelled is here, "in" and "on". Remember there is a small exception for small vehicles, so a small boat you can be in. Remember small. And a bicycle, you're always on the bicycle, because people see you sitting on it. We good? Excellent. Now, that is the lesson for transportation.</media:description>

<media:description>Culture has a big role to play in the way we speak. It dictates not only which language we use, but also the way we express ourselves with different people. For example, how direct and honest people are generally varies by region. Because of these differences, it is just as important to master culture as it is language. This lesson will help you understand how native speakers think. You will learn how to improve your communication skills depending on whom you are speaking with no matter where you go in the world! Take the quiz on this lesson at http://www.engvid.com/8-cultural-differences-between-native-speakers-and-english-learners/

TRANSCRIPT

Hmm. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Hi. James from engVid. I've often said that learning language, a foreign language is great. In this case, you're learning English, so congratulations. But a lot of students, they learn the language, and they kind of forget about the culture, like it doesn't really matter. Being an English speaker, I was born in England, and the culture from England is very different from the culture from Canada, even though they are closely related. So if you can imagine the cultural difference between someone from, say, China and Canada, that would be fantastically different.

Well, as they say, as much as we're different, we're the same. But in this case, I want to do a lesson on eight differences in culture that if you're learning the language, which would be important. Now, what I've done is shown the difference between the East and the West, because frankly, you may be from the Middle East or Asia, and you want to do business with Canadians or Americans or British people, and you should see what we think are important. And as well, this helps out English-speaking people about how we should communicate with you when we're trying to teach you English. You like that? Let's go to the board.

We have Mr. E, here. He wants to eat his... Let's see. What should he eat? I'm going to suggest that he has a pizza, because that's easy to draw, and anybody who knows me knows I'm a terrible drawer. There you go. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. He's having a piz-... Pepperoni pizza. What would you suggest he eat with? A knife or a fork, or chopsticks? Well, it seems obvious: Use your hands. See, when you understand, you can manipulate or use things to your advantage. Let's go to the board.

We'll start out with the West, which is where we are. All right? In the West, we say "respect is earned". That means I cannot give you respect or look up to you until you have done something to show me that you deserve my respect or I should give it to you. Just because you say: "Hello, my name is" doesn't mean anything. You have to say: "Hello, my name is, and I have done these things." Because of that and if you do something that helps me, I will give you my respect. Okay? In the East, it's a little different. In the East, what we say is: "respect is due to hierarchy". Hierarchy? Well, just like the word says, think "high", okay? The higher you are-okay?-the higher position you have. So if I come in and say: "I am Generalissimo Kareer." You go: "Oh, I must give you great respect", in the East, just because I am the General. I don't have to be a good General; I just have to be a General. You must give me respect. Well, in the West, you'd have to be a good General that's done a lot of good things.

Okay, number two: open debate is encouraged. If you're going: "What is open debate?" Open debate is conversation, but it's more conversation where two ideas are conflicting or they don't go together. You think A, they think B. So you don't both agree necessarily. Maybe you think: "I don't agree with this person, or I don't like everything they say", so you have a debate, which is a conversation to try and change each other's mind. Okay? Open debate in the West is encouraged. If you don't like my idea, I'll say: "Why? What's wrong with it? Why don't you come up with something? Tell me what you think, or tell me what's wrong with my ideas." The challenge, we think, brings a greater result. In other words, if you talk to me and we have a really good open debate, things should be better at the end of the debate. Let's look at the East. In the East, open debate and confrontation is avoided. Partly, this is because in the East... Remember we talked about hierarchy? There's a level or layers? Well, if you question someone and they are on a higher level, you are not showing them the respect they deserve, so it is almost better to do your debate... Or, not even debate, but questions in a less public area. So it is not open debate; more of a private thing with you and that person, and even then, you shouldn't really question them, but ask questions of them. Okay? That's number two.

Number three, let's look at individual success and material success. In the West, they matter, it's important. Yes, who I am is important, but it's who I am, just myself. Have I done well in school? Have I made a lot of money?</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from engVid. I would like to introduce to you three quick tips on learning English. It's difficult to learn anything, let's say, especially when you're learning a new language. So if I can give you something that will make it... Learning faster and easier, I think that will make you happy.

So let's go to the board and take a look at what I have for you here. So "3 Quick Tips", this is Mr. E, my buddy, we're together at all times. And the first tip I want to go to is reducing your stress. Well, when we reduce something, it means to make less. Right? And if you're wondering what stress is, stress is a funny word. It means you are afraid of something. People use "stress" because they don't usually know how to say what they're afraid of, so they say: "I feel stressed." If they don't have a job, for instance, they'll go: "I'm stressed. I have no job and no money." What they're really saying is: "I don't have a job. I'm afraid I cannot buy my food, my house, or my clothing, so I feel stressed." So we use "stress" for fear, because it makes you feel uncomfortable, and it's hard for you to express it, so you say: "stress".

So, we want to reduce your stress. I'm going to give you two hints, here, and one is going to be the opposite of the first one. It will seem crazy... [Aircraft noises]. See, now I'm stressed out, because that's a jet fighter. I'm definitely stressed. Okay? I'm stressed, so I'm going to do this real quick, because I don't have time for this now. Okay, reduce stress, reduce stress. So, relax.

First one: listen to music, watch TVs, and... Sorry, watch TVs. Watch videos, TV, and play games. Huh? Some of the best students I have ever had when I speak to them and go: "You learn pronunciation quickly, you've got this vocabulary, where did you get it from?" They're usually like: "I don't know, teacher. I, you... I play these games, they talk to me. I sometimes watch these videos, I sing with the videos. You know, I have to sound like the video. I love Michael Jackson. I, I just love it. It's so... So much fun for me." I go: -"How long do you do it?" -"I do it all the time, teacher. All the time, I do all day, all night." So they practice, but because they're having so much fun, they don't think they're working. And that's the key, you have to practice a lot. But nobody wants to practice something that's difficult and makes them afraid. Right? So, they do things they love doing, and then they come to learn English, and they say: "I know... Know English, but..." [Aircraft noises]. Okay, I'm getting stressed again. I'm going faster. But they learn quickly, and because they have a really good base or foundation knowledge, they can learn the rest of the English quickly and easily as well. And without stress, because they remember some of these words from the movies, the videogames, and the TV programs that they love. That's a good way to learn. Okay, good. Ready?

The next one... [Aircraft noises]. Okay, they're doing it to me. They're increasing my stress. Okay, so they were increasing my stress. Notice when I stressed out, I spoke really, really, really, really quickly, like now? And you're probably: "[Gasps]!" Well, here's the funny thing: If you do that long enough, you get calm. I'm going to calm down now. I know the planes are coming, they're coming again and again. We have an airshow going on right now. So I'm just going to relax. There's nothing I can do. Now, in getting rid of that stress, you might notice I'm speaking a lot slower, a lot more relaxed, and it's easier.

So, how do I increase my stress? One way to do it is take a sentence, read a book, and read that as fast as you can. I know you'll be stressed out, because you'll trip over the words... You'll trip over the words, that means you'll fall over the words because you're not used to them, but then when you go at a slower speed, they will come out beautifully; nice, flowing, eloquent. You know? Beautiful. So, what we want to do is go faster, so when we go slower it seems nice.</media:description>

<media:description>We never plan to get sick, but sometimes it happens. In this lesson, you'll learn vocabulary and expressions you need to visit a doctor, get a prescription, and buy the medicine you need. If you're traveling to an English-speaking country, this lesson is essential. I'll also give you my advice and warnings for buying and taking medication in an English-speaking country. Most importantly, remember that pharmacists are your friends. They will be happy to help you find the medication you need, and to give you exact instructions on how to take it. I hope your next visit to the drug store is a pleasant one. Don't worry, this lesson is non-drowsy!

Test your understanding of the lesson with my quiz: http://www.engvid.com/travel-english-getting-sick-and-buying-medicine/

TRANSCRIPT

E, you're going to need some medicine. Take your medicine. Dunh-dunh-dunh. Hi. James from engVid. Today's lesson is going to be on getting medicine, going to the pharmacy, and who you should see to get these things. Okay, look, you're learning English, and if you're really lucky, you're going to get to travel to different places, English-speaking places, and when you go there, it's not always going to be perfect. I'm hoping most of the time you have a great time, meet interesting people, but you might get sick or feel bad, and when you do, you're going to need someone to help you. And what I'd like to do is help you with today's lesson, and where we're going to talk about how we ack-... Not acknowledge, but we tell someone what's wrong with us, and how they help us get better. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

So, first: "symptoms". It's a nice, long word. What are your symptoms? "Symptoms" are the things that you feel when you don't feel well. If you say: "My back hurts", or "My head hurts", or "My stomach doesn't feel good", what we are saying is these are your symptoms. When you have a cold, you have a runny nose, your nose is runny-right?-sometimes-[coughs]-you cough, sometimes you have this - well, that would be a fever. If that's the symptoms, I'd say you have a flu; not a cold. All right? Okay.

So when you see a doctor, and that's who you go to, you go to a doctor, they'll ask you: "What are your symptoms?" And you say: "Doctor, my arm hurts and my back hurts." He'll go: "Okay. You know what? I think you have blah, blah, blah, and you need some medicine." So once you tell them the symptoms, if the doctor feels this is something you won't get better in, you know, two or three days, like: "You're tired, get some sleep, or eat some food", the doctor will tell you to get some medicine.

Now, in North America, which is Canada, United States, and Mexico - they have great... Well, we won't say Mexico, because English speaking, Canada, United States, Great Britain, Australia, you cannot get medicine just because you want it. You actually have to go to a special place, and you have to get what's called a prescription. A prescription actually... The word is "prescription", but we say "perscription". The prescription is the doctor saying what medicine you need. Remember we said medicine? And he signs or she will sign it, and say: "Please give this person that medicine." In this case, I said "he" because Mr. E, if you didn't know it, he's a doctor. He is a doctor, bona fide. Anyway, Mr. E will sign a piece of paper and give it to you.

You will then go to a place called "the pharmacy". The pharmacy is where we actually get medicine. Sometimes they actually make some of the medicines, or put them together there for you. Another word for "pharmacy" is "drug store". A lot of times, Canadians and Americans will go: "I'm going to the drug store to get something", because they don't just sell medicine and drugs-and "drugs" is another word for "medicine"-they sell other things you might need, you know, tooth paste, floss for your teeth, and we have a video on that if you really want to go check-okay?-on how to take care of yourself. But you go to the drug store or the pharmacy to get your medicine.

When you go there and you hand it, you're going to hand the piece of paper to the person called "the pharmacist". The pharmacist is the doctor that deals with giving out medicines. They will ask you for your prescription. When you hand them the prescription, they will-here we have number 5-fill your prescription. "Fill it", think of a bath tub, or yeah, a glass of water - it's empty, but as you put the water in, it fills up. Filling the prescription means putting the medicine inside of the bottle for you to take. The pharmacist will fill your prescription.</media:description>

<media:description>Today, you'll learn two sets of confusing vocabulary! Do you RAISE your hand, or RISE it? Do you LAY down, or LIE down? "Who is LAYING in my bed?" Or is that "Who is LYING in my bed?" This lesson will teach you the meaning of each of these words, and how each of them is used differently. Many native English speakers make mistakes with 'lay' and 'lie', but by the end of this lesson you will understand the grammatical reason why we use each of them in different situations. This is a part of the language that can be challenging for English learners because it has irregular verbs. But don't be scared! Mr. E and I will explain it and make it clear. So have a seat and let's learn some English! Afterwards, test your vocabulary knowledge with the quiz: http://www.engvid.com/confusing-english-lie-lay-raise-rise-arise/

TRANSCRIPT
Good morning. Hmm. Sorry. James from engVid. That probably raises a few questions for you. "Why did he say: 'Good morning', when it could be any time in the world?" Yeah. Well, I'm going to help you today, because that is a common word that we use in English, but there are some other words that are similar that many people make a mistake with. And I'm going to help you learn them today. That's "raise", "rise", "arise", "lay", and "lie".

Now, quick story: When I first heard this 10 years ago, I was teaching and a teacher asked me: "James, why do we raise or why do we rise?" And I didn't know. I honestly didn't know. Of course I know what... When to use them, but my problem was we just know because we've been taught, but no one actually sits you down and said: "The exact difference is this." So I had to study it. And today I'm going to help you not make the mistake I made, by knowing what it is and how to use it, or use them, because we have five words.

Let's go to the board. Do I raise my hand or rise my hand? Tough question if you don't know the differences between them. And I'm hoping this lesson will help you. In fact, by the time we're done, you should master this and be more fluent in your English use.

First one: "arise". If you ever watched any sci-... Scientific movie, sci-fi movie, there is some dead creature and some crazy magician or scientist goes: "Arise!" Well, we don't quite use it like that in English; we use it a little differently. When we talk about "arise", we mean something has occurred or something has happened. "A few things arose when you were away on vacation." That means things happened or occurred. Another way of saying it is: "come up". If you look at Mr. E at the bottom of the stairs, Mr. E 2 says: "Hey, come here." And he goes up the stairs, so something has come up. Hey, listen, there's a couple of things that I said arose or have arisen, things have come up or occurred that have happened and I want to talk about them. Okay? Cool. That's "arise".

Now, one other thing about "arise"... Let's just talk about it for a second. "Arise" is an irregular verb. Irregular verb? Well, most verbs follow a simple pattern; you add "ed" or add "d" to the end is past tense, there's a base form, and then there's the past participle form. And, you know, looks like "ed", "ed", and regular form. Easy. Irregular verbs means they don't follow that rule, so you have to change it. And unfortunately, there's no way for me to teach you and say: "With every irregular verb, you must do this." They're irregular because different ones look different ways. Sorry. But I'm going to help you by putting it here, and you can also go and study the charts for irregular verbs. Okay? I believe we have some on our engVid tools you can use or resources.

So, "arise", as I said, "come up", is an irregular verb; it doesn't follow the regular rules. So you're going to have to pay attention when I show you how it's spelt. The second thing I have here is intransitive. I spelt it over here for you, but intransitive. "Intransitive", well, "trans" in English... Or, sorry. Latin means across. It means it goes from one place to another. An intransitive verb means it doesn't take a direct object. Huh? Well, here's the example of transitive verb: "I love". If you're sitting there, you're probably thinking to yourself: "You love what? Ice cream? Football? Your mother? Your shoes?" Well, with a transitive verb, it takes an object or a direct object, meaning it has an effect on something else. "I love you." Yeah, I do, engVid watcher, I love you. You are my object, my love goes to you. That's what a transitive verb means, so the verb has to carry across to an object. While, an interested verb... Intransitive verb doesn't need that. All right? Well, I'll give you an example in a second because we have a few on the board. But in this case, "arise" is an intransitive verb. All right? You don't need to have an object with it. Okay?

Here, I'm going to give you the forms. "Arise" is present tense, "arose" is past tense, and when you use the past perfect or present perfect, use "arisen".</media:description>

<media:description>If you're learning English, you've probably seen 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person. But do you know what these mean? In this easy video, you'll learn to easily recognize first, second, and third person by understanding that these refer to the personal pronouns or the subject of the sentence. You'll see many examples and we'll practice finding out whether sentences are in first person, second person, or third person. You may have heard of "FPS" or "first person shooter" games. The idea is the same, and you will understand it after this lesson! Continue the exercise by doing the quiz at http://www.engvid.com/what-is-first-person-second-third/

TRANSCRIPT

 First, second, third, whether it be "I", "you", or... Hi. James from engVid. Today I'd like to teach you about the first, second, and third pronouns. Well, subject pronouns, to be exact. And: What do we mean by first person, second person, and third person? A lot of students have trouble with that, and that's why they use the pronouns incorrectly. This is a very simple, straightforward lesson, and I hope you enjoy it.

 Let's go to Mr. E. As you can see, he's standing on the podium. A "podium" is a box you stand on once you want to... When you want to speak or when you want to... Or when someone has got a position, like in the Olympics, they get first, second, and third position, so they stand up on a podium. E is on the podium with all three medals. Well, there's a reason for that, because you are important. And when we talk about subject pronouns, we're going to see how the first, second, and third person works. Ready? Let's go to the board.

 I mentioned Mr. E was wearing all the medals, and you're going to probably ask why. I'll show you. When we talk about personal pronouns or subject pronouns, the speaker is important, and who the speaker is speaking to is important, and this is how we can tell if something is first, second, or third person.

 Let's take a look at the first case. When I speak-or when E would speak-and I speak with friends, it's called the first person, and this is where we use for the singular, "I"; and for the plural, "we". Because I'm involved in the speaking, I am speaking with a group of people, and/or I am personally speaking. So we use "I" and "we" to say first person. Okay?

 When we talk about the second person, it's when I speak to you or I am speaking to a group of people. That means I, remember E is wearing the medals, I am directing my speech to somebody that I'm speaking to right now. I'm talking to you right now. Now, you, if you're watching at your house, I'm talking to you, that could be one person. But really, we know I'm on the internet, so there's thousands of people watching, but I'm speaking to you as well. So I am important and I am speaking to you, where I direct my speech, and that's why we call it the second person. The second person in the conversation, you might say. It could be one person or a group of people. And in this case, we use the same pronoun, "you" and "you" to talk about you, I'm directing my speech directly to you. Good? All right.

 Let's do the third person. The third person is when I speak about something or someone. You can think of it as they're not directly involved in the conversation. I could be talking about "it", that's the third person. Or I could be talking about "he" or "she", as in the third person. So this is when I speak about someone or something. For the singular, we have "he", "she", and "it", because we do talk about things. For the plural, we say "they". Cool? Great. That was a simple lesson. Let's go do a quiz on it. Are you ready? [Snaps].

 Ready for the quiz? Now, be very careful, this is a two-part quiz. First we're going to fill in the blanks with a proper or appropriate pronoun. Okay? Then we're going to try to see: Is that a first, second, or third pronoun? That'll be the second part we do. Are you ready? Let's try this quick quiz.

 "__________ am talking to them later."
 What would that be? Correct. "I am talking to them", we know this because the "am" is there. So that means the subject is speaking. Okay? The subject is speaking.

 How about the next one?
 "I saw them yesterday and __________ said they were going home today to see their families."
 I'll give you a little bit of a hint, here. We have "them", "they", and "their". That's right. These are all plural words, so we can make a safe guess that this would be "they". In this case, I am talking about them; not to them. Try to remember that when we do the second part, if I am talking about them, what does that mean?

 Number three:
 "_________ are the type of person that makes friends easily."
 Okay, well we can see it's one, "the" article says one type of person, so we have a choice between "I" and "you". Well, I don't think I'm talking about me. I think I'm talking to you. I think you're the friendly type of person, you watch engVid, you got to be a good guy or girl.</media:description>

<media:description>Have you ever broken the law? Today, I'm going to teach you courtroom vocabulary. It's important to know the law so that you know your rights and know how to stay out of trouble. If you do end up in court, you need to know what to expect and how to communicate politely and intelligently so that you get the best outcome. The vocabulary and expressions you'll learn will help you understand what is happening in courtrooms on television shows and movies, as well as if you have to appear in court yourself. Court isn't just for hardened criminals -- sometimes we have to go to court for "misdemeanours"-- small crimes like parking violations and littering, or you may have to go to court because of a lawsuit or as part of your job. In this video, I'll discuss different strategies that will help you speak with the people you'll meet in court -- lawyers, judges, and police officers. My best advice is to stay out of trouble, know how to talk to the police, and be informed if you have to go to court.
http://www.engvid.com/real-english-what-you-need-to-know-if-youre-going-to-court/

Dunh-dunh-dun-dun-dun-ne-dun-ne-dunh. engVid. Hi. James from engVid. I did a lesson before on sort of crime, when you get arrested by the police, and this is a second part, because there are two parts to a legal system or a law system. The first part is meeting the police, and the police saying you've done something wrong. The second part is when you actually have to get someone to say you are guilty or innocent. We'll go over that in a second or two: What does that mean? But you have to go before people, and they have to tell you everything is good and you can go home, or bad and you have to go to jail. You ready? Let's go to the board.

All right, so I was on my stool of justice, but probably gone for a second, here. Let's go to the board. There are a couple terms we want to talk about. Remember we talked about being arrested? Well, the second part is going to court. We like to say: "You have your day in court", which means that you cannot go to jail for no reason. Someone has to say you've done something wrong, and they have to show it. So, this video is about the process of how that happens. Okay? These are called "handcuffs". Handcuffs. Usually you see the police, they put them on you. Well, on you, not on me, if you do something bad. Or you see bad guys wearing handcuffs. And the reason why I did handcuffs is because the two things go together. If you get arrested, you need to go to court. All right? So let's get a start.

You'll notice that we have funny pictures up here, so we're going to try and figure out what these pictures mean. The first one you notice is an ear. Well, in North America, before you go to a long-term prison, I give you example. If you drink a little one night, they can put you in jail for one night, but then they usually let you go the next day, so there's nothing special about that. But if they want to put you in jail for a longer period of time, they actually have to give you a "trial". Okay? That's a word up here.

But you need to have a "hearing". The hearing is where you go in front of a judge, and that is a man or a woman who listens to what you have to say, and they listen to what the police say, and they decide if they should say: "This is it, don't worry about it", or: "This is serious, and we need to go further." This will happen in cases of murder, and large theft, like $10,000, $100,000, $200,000 or any kind of sexual crime. If you walk across the street when cars are coming, don't worry about it, you won't need a hearing. But you notice ear is for "hearing", so this will tell you the first part is a hearing. "Hearing" because the judge needs to hear what you have to say, because the police have said you're bad, and you get to say: "Hey, look, it wasn't me", or: "It's not what... That's not what happened." So you go for a hearing.

Now, after the hearing, the judge will decide, and they will decide if you have a "trial". There are two people you must know will be at the trial. One is... Okay. The first is the "judge". The "judge" is the person with this thing. Oh, not exactly the best drawing in the world, looks like Thor's hammer, but it's called a "gavel". Bang. That's when they tell you the decision, they hit the gavel. So that will be the judge.

The other person that will be at your trial will be a "lawyer". Your lawyer. You're going to need one. Make sure if you ever get in this situation, you get a lawyer. In America, it's called an "attorney". They can use both terms, "lawyer" or "attorney". "Lawyer" is commonly used through English-speaking countries. Okay? So, there's also a lawyer for the other side, because there's you, and you're called the "defense", and on the other side, depending who they're representing, the government or another person. Okay?</media:description>

<media:description>When you go to another country, it is just as important to learn about the culture and the laws as it is the language. In North America, we try to be polite to everyone, including to the police. In this lesson, you will learn the proper way to behave when being stopped by a police officer. Some vocabulary and expressions you will need to understand include "driver's license", "fine", "bail money", "courts", "under arrest", "breaking the law", and more. It is very important to know what your rights are in the event you do get in trouble, so watch this lesson and stay safe.

TRANSCRIPT 

After they ask you to stop, they're going to ask for I.D. For some of you, you'll say: "What is I.D.?" Well, it's identification, sort of like your passport or your country... Some people have identification cards in their country. Funny, in Canada, we don't have this thing. We have drivers' licenses, and we have passports, but we don't have citizenship cards, or-sorry-citizen cards. We use our driver's license. So it might be your citizen card that they would request. If you come to our country, they would ask you for I.D., so you could present your passport or your citizen card. That's probably all you have. So, number two in the process will be asking for your I.D.

Now, you notice this is orange and we have this strange word: "rights", and I'm not talking your right hand. In Canada, the United States, Great Britain, New Zealand, Scotland, Wales, they have rights. Or, sorry, you have rights, which mean before you do anything the police say, you are allowed to ask certain questions. So you can say: "I know my rights." By the way, I would never say that to a policeman who stopped you. You're just asking for trouble.

But, at the time they ask you to stop or they ask you to give I.D., you can then start using your rights. One of the first things you can say is: "Hi, Officer, what's your name or badge number?" In Canada, they must give it to you. Okay? But be smart, ask nicely, like: "Okay, no problem, Officer. I just want to know: Who am I talking to? I just want to know I'm talking to the law." The officer will then either point to their shoulder where there is a number located, or they'll say their name, which is usually located on the front of their shirt. So: "Officer Johnson, 531 Division." You go: "Thank you, Officer."

You can then say this... Remember, each time you're doing this, police don't usually like being questioned, so always be polite. Don't flunk the attitude test. I'll explain that to you after. So then you can say: "Officer, why am I being stopped?" The officer at that time, especially if they ask for your I.D. must tell you why you're being stopped. Okay? This will lead to... Well, we go up to here, being charged, but let's go here first.

You can then say, before they do anything else: "Am I under arrest?" If the officer says: "You're not under arrest", you may walk away. You can leave. You can still be polite, and I recommend that, but you don't have to answer any of their questions, because once the officer has told you why he stopped you or she has stopped you, if you are not under arrest, you do not need to speak anymore. If they ask further questions, you can say: "If I'm not under arrest and you want more from me, I need to talk to a lawyer first, because I don't know why I'm standing here." These are your basic rights in Canada, United States, and Great Britain. As I said, each country varies, so be careful. Okay? And always, always, always be polite.

Now, let's just say you a bad boy or a bad girl. Well, we've gone past the rights stage, and the stop, and the I.D., they have to tell you what you're charged with. That means you've done something wrong, and that means you cannot walk away from the police at that point. This is called... You say: "Am I being charged with anything?" They must tell you what you have done. "We think you killed somebody.", "We think you stole a car.", "We think you hit someone."

At this point, something is going to happen, either one or two things. Oh, this is not the good part. If it's a small thing, and we call it "not criminal", meaning you didn't do anything that they need to put you in jail for, you will get a fine. What kind of things? If you're driving your castal-... Your car a little too fast, or if you drop... Actually, this is true, drop garbage in certain places where you're not supposed to drop your garbage. You don't put it away, you drop it on the floor, the police can walk up to you and say: "I'm going to give you a fine." They will give you a ticket. You'll notice this. And if you can't read this, you shouldn't.</media:description>

<media:description>In this English lesson for beginners, I will teach you the correct expressions to use to talk about your gadgets. We often use 'turn' phrasal verbs to talk about using gadgets or electronics. By the end of the lesson, you will know how to use the prepositions 'ON', 'OFF', 'UP', and 'DOWN' with the verb 'TURN'. This is an easy lesson, but many students make mistakes using these words. Don't be one of them! Watch my video, then take the quiz at: http://www.engvid.com/easy-english-lesson-turn-on-turn-off-turn-up-turn-down/

TRANSCRIPT

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Hello. Hi. James from engVid. You might have noticed that my voice changed. I went from soft to loud. Now, many students I find have a problem when it comes to electronics. They don't know whether they should use, or if they should use "up", "down", "on", or "off". Today is a basic lesson on those things. So, let's go to the board and take a look.

Now, when we talk about electronics, which could be something as simple as your cellphone-okay?-what happens is people want to use them, which is fine if you're doing it for yourself, but when you're talking to other people and you want them to do something for you. You notice that this cellphone is, would you say "down" or "off"? All right? That's the lesson we're going to do today. What do you say when you want to change the condition of this cellphone? We'll start right now.

E, so are we going to turn up the volume or turn on the volume? Well, I notice "dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh" the music is already on. This is low volume and this is high volume, but how do we change them? Let's start with some basic definitions.

First, "turn", that was a turn. It's to move around a centre. Here's a centre, I turn around a centre, or to reverse a position. Interesting. Both of these definitions we need to understand if we say: "turn up" or "turn on". The first one, to turn around a centre, we have to go back in time a little bit. You're from the Modern Age, so when you press your toys, you just press. But when I was a little boy a long time ago, when the Indians rode on the plains... I'm not that old, but I feel that way. What happened was we used to have televisions and radios, and we would turn, we would turn them if we wanted more volume.

So if you look over here, where I said turn means to reverse a position, you have 360. So, I feel like we're doing an old science lesson. And boys and girls, we will now demonstrate the turning mechanism. Here we go. We will turn up the power, and turn down the power. Which means reverse. So we're going to look here, and you notice I have to turn. Okay? This is a very old machine. Some of you won't recognize this. It's a film projector. Yeah, we don't use these now. Anyway. But the point was: The technology, you had to actually do something with it, and that's where we get the ideas for "up", "down", "on", and "off". We're switching. We're either reversing the position or moving around a centre.

Now, when you have a lot of movement or 360, which is basically a circle... All right? When you have a circle, this is why we talk about turning up and down, because as you turn it, you can increase the power or decrease the power, or make the sound higher or make the sound lower. In fact, in the old days, they used to do this for television, radios, and lights. You would turn up and you would increase it so it would get more. So here's the 360, or you would go more, more, more, more, more. Or you would turn it down and decrease it and you would get less, less, less, less. So the room could be darker if you're talking about light. If sounds all of a sudden the voice would get lower, lower and disappear. Okay.

So that's why when we talk about volume on televisions or radios, we say: "Hey, could you turn up the volume?" And if you think about this machine, okay? Turn up the volume, turn down the volume.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Action. Hi. James from engVid. You're used to me talking about English. Grammar, conversation lessons, and whatnot. Today, we're going to do something a little different. I want you to maximize your learning from not just engVid, but from YouTube. And there are some features on there that I don't think you're aware of, that by the time I'm done, you'll understand how to use them, and then I'm going to teach you how to actually watch our videos to get your maximum learning capacity, or your ability to learn. Are you ready? It's a small adventure, so let's get started, shall we?

As you can see, E is over here, and he's is saying: "Wow, look at me." And there are these strange buttons. Now, some of you are completely aware of what they are, and some of you don't know. And unfortunately, if you don't know, you're missing out on some of the best tools to help you learn how to learn English, or anything on YouTube. Right? But especially for engVid, this is helpful. Now, there are three buttons that I want to discuss with you, and then after, I'm going to give you a kind of detailed approach on how to use our videos, so you can learn as much as you can.

Let's take a look at the buttons. First thing is CC. You'll notice where that's located, here. Now, do keep in mind that depending on what machine you're using, and over time, YouTube changes where these things are, but they should essentially be here. And at this time when I'm taking the video or I'm making the video, it's in this position, here. So remember: If you've got an app or a different type of system, it might be a little differently placed, but it essentially will be the same. "CC" means closed captioning. For some of you, that means subtitles. Those are the words that are appearing underneath when I'm speaking. Okay?

Now, why do you need to know that? Well, it depends on what kind of student you are. I personally don't like when students use subtitles, if they're a higher level, because it handicaps them or makes it difficult, because they tend to read, or they have the habit of reading instead of actually listening. But if you're new to the language and you don't know any of the words, and there's a lot of words that you don't know, it's a good thing to have subtitles so you can read along with the speaker, and that helps you to understand. So you can use the CC button to turn on the captions. Now, if you're a senior or seasoned engVid watcher, perhaps you want to turn them off a little bit to challenge yourself. See how good you are. So you can listen to the speaker, write down notes, see if you got it correctly, and then turn back on the closed captioning to see if you've done a good job. Cool. All right? So that's closed captioning. It is the text at the bottom, sometimes called subtitles.

The next one is this funny-looking thing. It's called a gear. If you know anything about watches or cars, these are the things with teeth that join and they move. Why do they move? Because they have several operations. The one operation we want to talk about is actually the speed setting. This is especially good for people who want to increase their comprehension or improve on their listening skills. If it's not a comprehension, just catching the language. You'll press the gear button, and once you go in there, there are several options. The only one I'm going to speak about right now is speed. This one's for you. Go to the settings, or the gear, and press speed. You'll notice you can go faster or slower.</media:description>

<media:description>Do you know how to use commas? In this lesson, you'll learn simple rules for using commas with coordinating conjunctions. Coordinating conjunctions connect two ideas or clauses in a sentence. We'll look at the most common conjunctions: 'for', 'and', 'nor', 'but', 'or', 'yet', and 'so'. Knowing how to place commas in your sentences will help you to write better, and will make your writing easier to read. This grammar lesson is essential for anyone who wants to improve their English writing. It is especially important for university writing, or if you're taking IELTS or TOEFL. So join me in this fun lesson, and learn to love the comma! And take the quiz on this lesson at http://www.engvid.com/writing-skills-commas-conjunctions/

TRANSCRIPT

Fanboy and Comma girl, a love story. By Mr. E. Hi. I'm James from engVid. And you're probably wondering: What the hell am I talking about? Fanboy and Comma... Comma Girl, okay? She's a superhero, and our boy loves her. In case you don't know what a fanboy is because you may not follow comics or movies as religiously as these guys do, I've got a definition for you. So let's just read: What is a "fanboy"? A person who is loyal to a game, person, or company, regardless if it sucks or not. That's not quite true, but what they are talking about is that fanboys love their products. If they love Apple, it is the best the universe has ever produced. And if Apple does something wrong, help them, somebody help them because they will be angry. But generally put, they just love their products so much, they let everybody know about them. Anybody with ears that will listen or who cannot escape from them. All right?

So how does this have anything to do with English and grammar? Well, this is a grammar lesson, and I find sometimes grammar can be incredibly boring, so let's make it a little bit fun. So we created a love story by Mr. E. Now, let's start off with comma. Because what is this lesson about? It's how, well, conjunctions, which I'm going to get to, work with commas and sentences. Some of you might have problems with them, I mean, some of you might even go: "Conjunctions, what are they?" So I'm going to talk about the most common conjunctions, and I'm going to talk about comma usage. Okay? We're going to do a quick lesson, here, and I'll make it fun. You ready?

So the first thing we should talk about is a comma. What is a comma? It's a punctuation mark. When you have sentences, there's a time to take a breath or to complete it. Okay? Now, periods, you may know, end sentences or ends thoughts. A comma sometimes gives us a breath or it gives us a pause between parts of a sentence, or gives you time to catch your breath, or get part of an idea. Okay? We also use it for lists. There's Frank, okay? Frank, Billy, John, Susie, you know, lists. Lists of things. Knives, forks, scissors, dah, dah, dah, and you'll have comma, comma, comma, separating them, keeping them individual. And finally, we can also... Well, there's more uses, but these are general. We can use them for numbers, large numbers. You know this, we can say 1,000, there'll be a comma to indicate 1,000, and two commas to indicate 1,000,000. So largers... Numbers larger than 1,000, you'll have commas somewhere. All right? That's basically what the comma is used for. Three different uses.

So, what are fanboys? Well, I told you they're excited about everything, right? Well, there's a little bit more than that. They're conjunctions. If we look here, I wrote "conjunction", and I put exactly what a conjunction is. It means to join something together. In this case, when we have usually conjunctions, we join two ideas together. If we use a conjunction with a comma, normally you're going to have clauses, and the clauses will be balanced or equal. Okay? Later on we'll go into all of that, but that's what's going to happen when we have usually a comma and a conjunction. You know, there are clauses being used and they're balanced.

But: "What are the conjunctions?" you might ask. Well, let's start off with... These are the basic ones. There are more, but these are the most common ones, and we use this acronym which is a word made up from the first letter of each word so you have something that's easy to remember, and I chose FANBOYS. And in a second, I'll reveal why. "For", it gives you a reason. Why did they do this? Okay? "And" ideas that go together.</media:description>

<media:description>In English there are many ways to talk about the things we have. We use words like borrow, lend, supply, rent, lease, and many more. In today's lesson, I'll show you when to use these words and teach you many others words you can use in daily conversation. As always, I'm going to show you the vocabulary in use, so that you hear how native speakers talk. You'll also learn several expressions that have to do with ownership.

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from engVid. I've noticed a lot of people have a problem using "borrow" or "lend". In fact, sometimes I found it difficult to teach it to people. But today's lesson, I'm going to try to simplify it and make it easy. Now, there's probably one or two lessons on borrow and lend on engVid already, so please feel free to check them out. I just try to simplify it, and give you a couple of phrases or expressions, general expressions you can use.

So let's go to the board. As you can see, I've got some money, and E is trying to... Oh, is he trying to borrow or lend? Let's go find out. Okay? So, Mr. E says: "Can I borrow $5?" And the other worm, I don't know who this is, says: "I don't have that on my person." When someone says that, it means: "I don't have it with me." Look underneath here, it says: "Neither a borrower nor a lender be". Well, what does that mean? Okay? We want to do a lesson on borrow and lend, correct? And look here, "borrow", "lend". Today I'm going to give you something that'll help you remember it easily, what the difference between the two are so you can use them properly. And then we're going to learn some other words that are similar. Yeah, synonyms, because I think as... If you understand one thing properly, we can teach you many other things, so the lesson can just grow and grow. And you're smart, so let's get started.

All right? E talk to me. Well, what's the difference? We have "having", "giving", "receiving", and "miscellaneous". These are the four legs of our table. All right? Every table has four legs, and when people exchange things, or give, or receive, it's going to be one of these four legs we're talking about. Let's talk about the first leg: "having". You can't give if you don't have. Right? So, we'll start with "having". People, we'll start with a noun. So what are nouns for "people"? "Owners". When you own something, it belongs to you or it is yours. Okay? I own my body, I own this pen, and this jacket. They are mine. Okay? I'm an owner. Now, when you have a house and you have paid for the house, you become a "landlord" or a "landlady". Lady, me lady. Right? And the lord, you are the lord of the manner. You own your own home. Mwahahahahahaha. Yes. A "landlord" is when you go someplace, you need a place to stay but you cannot buy a house, you will pay these people on a monthly basis, and they will give you a place to stay. And they're called "land owners". You will generally say, if it's a man: "My landlord wants the rent today." Or, if it's a woman, you'll say: "The landlady wants the rent", because they own the land that you live on. Okay? And this goes back a long time ago to kings and queens when they owned everything, and they were called the lords and the ladies of the land.

Now, "proprietor". Can you say that again? "Proprietor", "proprietor". This is the formal word for an owner. This is usually used for a business. Okay? So you might own a bicycle or a motorcycle or something, but you're not the proprietor. When you talk about proprietors, think about restaurants and stores. Okay? It's the formal word for "owner", and it's used for those people. So if you come to McDonald's, you go: "Who's the proprietor?" Ronald McDonald will come out and go: "Hi. Hi. Here's my friends." He's not the proprietor; he's just a cartoon guy. But the person who owns the business is the proprietor of it. Think restaurant, bar, store. "Owner" can be for a home or of a marker. I own a marker. I am not the proprietor. Okay? Landlord, landlady, they own the land which you are a "tenant" or a "renter".

Let's go on to "having" for things. Now, for these are the people owned, what do we call things that we own? Well, "property". Property is something that belongs to you. We also use "property" for land: "This is my property." It means my house has this much land, and I own all of it; it's all mine. My property. But something small, such as a pen, a watch, my shoes-you can't see them, I just lifted my leg up-my shoes, they're my property. Okay? They belong to me. "Possessions" is the same thing. "To possess" means to take on. If you're possessed by a demon, it controls you. So when you have something in your possession, you have control over it or it belongs to you. It can be either one.</media:description>

<media:description>Learn to speak English with me! A "compliment" has the same meaning as "praise" and means to say nice things about people. The opposite of that is "to criticize". It is never easy to criticize politely. Find out how to do just that in this useful lesson on compliments and criticism. In this video, you will learn how to give praise in English and also how to tell people what they are doing wrong. You will also learn the meaning of other words like "critique" and "critic". Avoid being rude or awkward, and learn how to achieve constructive results when talking to people about good and bad things!

TRANSCRIPT

[Singing] E, what you...? Hi. James from engVid. I've noticed my friend, E, is putting butter all over his little wormy body, and standing in the sun. I think he wants to be tanned. This is not the best way to get a tan, by the way. I'm just telling you. Don't put butter on yourself and sit in the sun. But this is strange: "Butter me up, baby." Hmm. And then: "Flattery will get you everywhere with Mr. E." What does that mean? That's today's lesson.

What we want to talk about is "criticism" and "praise", or "criticize" and "praise". We have synonyms we're going to work with, and then some common popular expressions. Right? To help you be able to use them in real life, so you can become like a native speaker. And let's go to the board to start.

We have a little seesaw here. or heehaw, whatever. And you notice a balance, it's balancing down for criticize, because criticism is usually considered negative. Okay? And praise is usually considered good. So you can think of devil - dun-dun-dun-dun", or angel - aaah. Okay?

So, when we say somebody criticizes something it's they say something bad about something. Okay? "The food is too salty, it's too hot. The room's too warm. The car's too big." They criticize it. When they praise it, they might say: "It's very roomy", or: "The food is full of flavour", or: "You did a good job." To praise. Opposites. Right?

So let's go start over here because I'm that kind of guy, and I'm going to look at "critic". So the noun, a person who criticizes is a critic. Now, a critic doesn't necessarily always have to be negative. It's considered negative, because when a critic speaks, they're going to talk about the things that didn't go well or weren't as good as they thought. Okay? Now, a critic is also a job, because they might go see a movie or a book, and they'll tell you what they loved about the book. But no critic will keep their jobs if they just say: "Everything was just great. I loved everything. I love all of the movies." They won't have a job very long, because people say: "Not everything's good." So a critic's job is to look at things, maybe say some things are good, but to tell you what was missing and what could have been done better. So that's an official job, a critic. But a critic could also be someone who finds faults, so we mean they look for things to be wrong, and then mention it. They can't just be happy. You're eating dinner, it's a good restaurant, but the lighting's not quite right and they're like: "Everything good, but the lighting wasn't right and I don't like it." Why do you got to be such a critic? Why do you have to bring something negative?

The second one is "cynic". Oh, sorry, I'm wrong. "Pessimist". A pessimist... Unlike a critic, a critic as I said can be a job or someone who finds some fault. A pessimist sees almost everything in a negative light. They see any situation, in a person - they see the worst or something bad. You say: -"It's a beautiful sunny day. Like the birds are out, children are smiling. I got a new car, a new job." -"It's going to rain soon." -"Why you got to bring that up? The children are out, everything's good. Why do you have to talk about it?" -"It will rain. It always does." -"Yes, but not today." Okay? So a pessimist will say something will happen or you go: -"Look at my brand new car." -"It will break down." -"Okay. Leave it alone. I just got it. Okay?" Pessimist.

So, cynic, we get it. Could be a job or someone finds some fault in something. Okay? A pessimist sees everything is negative, there's always a negative something to everything. It's not just looking at a book. Life's a bad situation. "You're born and you're going to die." This is a pessimist. They can't see: but you are alive.

So what's a "cynic"? Or what's this "kynikos", kynikos, kynikos. K9, k-ni-, kyninikini. Well, let's look. This is actually a Greek word, and this Greek word has to do with doglike. So what does doglike and cynic have to do? Well, the pessimist is negative about everything. Everything's bad. Sun: "Oh, the sun's out. You're going to get cancer."</media:description>

<media:description>Some everyday words are used incorrectly every day. Did that last sentence make any sense to you? Don't worry if it didn't. Even native English speakers sometimes do not know the difference between "maybe" and "may be". In this lesson, you will learn the difference between three word pairs and how to use them correctly every time. Try our quiz at the end to test your knowledge and get extra practice.

TRANSCRIPT

"To be strong and to have speed is not the same as having power and quickness. These are easily confused." Hi. James from engVid. I'm reading Miyamoto Musashi on strategy. Hiya! Except Mr. Musashi said something rather interesting, and that's today's lesson. Confusing words. You probably heard me talk about speed and strength being confused with power and quickness. We native speakers regularly confuse it, thinking that they are the same things, and there are other words that I know you probably have problems with, and maybe some native speakers as well, and we're going to learn them today. You ready? Let's go to the board.

So. Confused words. Mr. E, Sensei. What do we have? "Everyday, I ain't learned nothing, but may be I should have studied harder!" Okay, I'm putting on an accent and playing. Mr. E is saying: "Every day..." And "ain't" is bad English. We've got a video on that, so go check it out, okay? It talks about when people say it, and then you'll understand my strange accent. Okay? And: "Learned nothing, but I should have studied harder." Well, there are... There's a confused word here and here, and this word is wrong. When we finish the lesson, you'll understand why I say that, and why these confuse people.

The first one we're going to do is "study" versus "learn." What does it mean to study, and what does it mean to learn? It's often been said: "You can study a lot, and learn nothing." Why? Because learning, when you learn something, you gain knowledge by studying, by practicing. You know, you play the piano again, and again, and again, that's practice. You don't look at the keys, ding dong dong, you actually practice it to get it into your body, so to speak. When you study, that's more like reading or trying to memorize things, right? For a test.

So learning, you are going to gain a skill, or you will get knowledge. You will learn something new, something you didn't understand, you will now understand. Okay? There's something you will have. It may not be something you put in your hand, but it's something you put in your head. Okay? And the best thing about it is not only have you put it in your head, you can now take this information and use it to learn new things, or use it to do things. Right? You can study how to make a cake, but when you learn how to make a cake, you have a recipe. Right? And you can use that recipe again and again.

Studying is a little different. Why? Because studying is actually a part of learning. If you look carefully up here, it says: "Studying, practicing, being taught." You know, somebody... Somebody will teach you. You go and you get a teacher. A teacher says: "You're doing this, this, this, and this." You're not reading and memorizing; someone is speaking to you. And even when we talk about learning experience, right? Trust me: if you get hit by a car... I've been hit by a car three times, man. Not fun. Riding a bicycle, boom! You learn: look both ways, and be smart. You didn't have to memorize that. One hit by a car - you will learn, okay? So, that's what learning means.

When you study, we talk about studying being reading, right? Memorizing facts, that means trying to put it in your memory so you don't have to keep thinking about it. But another thing about study which is a little confusing is when you attend school. What do I mean? Well, when you attend school, you go for classes, right? So sometimes you hear people say: "What do you study?" And they're talking about what is the subject, right? Or: "What are your classes? Do you take mathematics?" You say: "I'm studying math, geography, and history this term." Studying, that means memorizing some facts from these and reading about them. Okay? Or: -"What are you studying?" -"The law. I'm going to get a law degree", or: "I'm going to get a medical degree." You cannot learn a medical degree, you study for a medical degree. So when we say "study," we talk about attending school. What school do you go to? What subject, what classes?</media:description>

<media:description>Did you know that a lot of words in the English language actually come from other languages? When you say "hamburger", "mentor", "saxophone", or "spartan", you are using words that originated in countries such as Belgium, Germany, and Greece. Learn some new vocabulary and, along with that, a bit of history by watching this interesting lesson on foreign words. You will realize that English borrows much more from other languages than you thought. Do you know of any English words that are from your language? Be sure to share them in the comments section!

TRANSCRIPT

Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. Hi. James from engVid. We always do very serious lessons. Well, kind of serious lessons, in my case, but usually, you know, we stick with the grammar, the idioms, vocabulary, and whatnot, and every once in a while, it's just kind of fun to find out where words are. There's nothing wrong with learning for learning sake. In fact, when you learn that way and you're having fun, you're probably going to want to learn more. Okay? Even myself, I've taught English for at least 10 years. Probably longer; gosh knows. Every once in a while I'm fascinated when I learn the history of something that I didn't know existed or, you know, why we use this instead of that, or there used to be something else. It's fascinating.

So today, we're going to have a bit of a fun lesson where you're going to learn about English words. You're still going to learn how to use them, but we're going to look at words that actually come from you, the viewing audience. You guys always watch us. Now we're going to return the favour and tell you about words that come from your countries, your languages that we brought. Okay? So these are words from around the world, brought to you by Mr. E. And you can see our globe is here. And we're going to take a first look at our visual words, and then we're going to do a few others and give you some definitions. You ready? Let's do the first one.

What could be more American in the world than the hamburger? There's McDonald's hamburgers, Big Boy burgers, just burgers. Right? The hamburger and the hot dog are American as apple pie. But what if I told you the hamburger is not American? Right now there are about a million Americans having heart attacks, like: "Don't take that away from us. That's American like apple pie." Like an American German apple pie? [Laughs] You'll see, in the country Germany there is a place called Hamburg, and the hamburger wasn't served on a bun. That, I have to give to the Americans, they put it on a bun. Because you know they're lazy... I didn't say that, guys, but they don't want to use knife and fork, so they use a bun. In Hamburg, they had the patty, the beef patty, and they would eat it that way. It took an American to put some bread underneath and bread on top, and have that patty that way. But it... Hamburger was originally from Hamburg and it was just a meat patty. Didn't know that, did you? That's right, Americans, I've got more. [Laughs]

What's next? Popular instrument. If you love jazz [makes music noise] that's not even a saxophone; I don't know how to play. Go watch The Simpsons and watch Lisa Simpson, she plays the saxophone. I had a teacher named David Mott, great guy, he also played the sax. Professional jazz player. Sexy instrument. Now, the saxophone, it sounds very French, no? The French people right now are going: "Of course, it's magnifique. It's ours. It is a phone. It is a sax." I've got news for you: bloody Germans... Well, not Germans. This guy's... This time the guy's from Belgium. His name was Adolphe Sax. Okay? "Adolphe" is spelt "ph", so you've got your "ph" here. "Saxophone", it was his musical scene. He's from Belgium. Belgium? Except from The Muscles from Brussels, Jean-Claude Van Damme, nothing comes from Belgium. And chocolates. But they also made the saxophone. Cool? There you go.</media:description>

<media:description>Would you say, "Did you like THIS book" or "THAT book?" What about "THESE books" and "THOSE books?" How can you know which of these two words is correct and when? Learn to use "this" and "that" and their plural forms like a native speaker by watching this useful lesson on demonstratives. You will learn the difference between when the demonstrative is a pronoun and when it is an adjective and when to use them. Now, THAT is a great way to spend THESE next ten minutes! Don't forget to try my quiz afterwards so you can test your understanding: http://www.engvid.com/learn-english-difference-this-that/

Изучаем английский Разница между THIS и THAT

TRANSCRIPT:
You can go for this, or you can go for that. You can go for this, you can... Hi. James from engVid. Yeah, sorry, I was just singing a song by Fat Boy Slim; came out 2006. It's about demonstratives. I mean, you could go for this, or you could go for that. And you're going to say: "Why did I change it?" We're going to do demonstratives, and you're going to understand why I was singing and doing that little dance, and you're going to find out why I moved the book to me and away from me when I changed. You ready? Let's go to the board.

All right, so E is talking about "this" or "that". No difference here, but there is a difference over here. When we say "this" in English, we mean something is near or close. For instance: "Are you talking about this book?" Or maybe you're talking about that book. You go: "That book, yeah, that book. It was over there." So "this" is here. When we talk about "this", we're talking about here. When we talk about "that", we're talking about there. Okay? See? Near is close to you, and that is not close or far. Another way to remember it if you get a little confused, see the "a" in "that", it means away, away from you. Cool? All right, I thought you'd like that. It's considered relative distance. "Relative" meaning there's no real distance. I can say: "I like this marker", but it's not near to me, but it's closer than the marker that's over there. Okay? All right. Good.

Now, there are two types of demonstratives. We can talk about pronouns and adjectives, but before we get there, let's look at what a pronoun is. A pronoun is something that can stand by itself; it represents something. You know these already: "he", "she', "it", "we", "they", "us", they're pronouns. Right? Some are subjects, some are object. Right? They represent nouns. For instance, if I said: "Mr. E is happy", I can then afterwards say: "He is going... He is happy because he is going to a party." "He" represents E. All right? So it's a pronoun, but it can also stand by itself as in: "He is sitting in the room by himself." Right? We know "he" is a male of some type sitting in a room.

When we talk about an adjective, we use adjectives to describe nouns, so they help us with nouns. What kind of man? The tall man is sitting in the room by himself. Still talking about a man, but now we have more information, and that's what adjectives do. They describe nouns.

So as we move down here and we look at demonstrative... Demonstratives, we can have them either as pronouns and adjectives. What do we mean? When a demonstrative is a pronoun, it comes... Oops. It comes before a verb. Right? Or it could be a verb by itself. Okay? So we could say: "This is my car." Notice: "this" is the pronoun, "is my car", like: "it is my car". Same, except we're using "this". Right?

Now, where do you think that car is when you say: "This is my car"? Do you think it's way over there or maybe it's here? Probably here. I'm probably opening the door-ch, ch-"This is my car. That is his car over there." All right? And you can say... See how it stands by itself? "Do you like that?" Or: "Did you like that?" Something happened. Right? Maybe somebody, you know, said: "Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you", and I say: "Hey, did you like that, the fact that they were singing?" Did you like that? It can stand on its own. All right? Here, as we said, is the verb, and our pronoun; and here it stands by itself.

Now, what happens when we want to actually use it to help...? Help us describe something? All right? We're going to go over here to the demonstrative adjective. All right? Now this is really easy. You just put "this" before a noun. "This cup", "This book", "This marker". You just learned demonstrative adjectives. What are you talking about? This marker or this marker? That's it. Put it in front. And here we go, right? "This car is mine." So you can imagine there's a car, and I'm saying: "This car" to describe which kind of car? This car. And: "Did you like that book? Did you like that book?"</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Joker, you've never been anything but an empty suit. If you ever come to Gotham again, I'll be all over you like a cheap suit.

Not my best Batman, but... Hi, welcome to engVid. I'm James, and this is Mr. E. Today's lesson is on the word "suit". I'm wearing the bat suit, and I'm sure you've heard of Batman. And if you haven't, when you're done this, go watch the Batman movie and then come back, and this will be funny. All right? Anyway, welcome to engVid. James. Mr. E, and Mr. E. Oh. "Censored", this means you're not allowed to look or you can't see it; there's something wrong. So, why don't we talk about why I'm wearing a bat suit, why E is wearing a suit, and why he's censored over here? Let's go to the board. [Laughs] Okay, anyway.

So, "suit" is what we're working with today. "Suit" is a word that could be either a verb or a noun in English, and we usually use it with a lot of expressions. So, today, we're going to work on the expressions that we use it for.

Let's start with the first one. I've divided the board into business and personal, or should I say: "Personal and business", because I'm awake, and we're going to find out how "suit" is used in the business world and in your personal life, so you can use this word outside, you know, with your friends, joking around, having fun or actually when you go to work. Ready? Let's go to the board.

"Birthday suit", you're naked, baby - no clothes whatsoever. And if you look very carefully, E is censored, because he's in his birthday suit. He has no clothing. He looks a little too happy, right? If you take a look, a little too happy for my liking.

Now, what about him wearing a suit here? We've got "birthday suit", to "suit up". There's a program in North America called How I Met Your Mother, and there's a guy called Barney. Barney's hilarious. And whenever he wants to go meet women... He's got a friend. I forget his name. He always goes: "Let's suit up", and they go on and they put suits. That's a suit and a tie, and they dress up. And as you can see here, Mr. E is suited up. He has put on his shirt and his tie. He wants to look good. It means to look good and attractive.

Another meaning for "suit up" is this: in the military, they might say: "Suit up, boys!" It means: get your weapons, get ready for battle or for action. Sometimes they say in sports: "Suit up!" Get your uniform on. Get ready for action. So you could say it's for putting on a suit, or: put on clothes for action, because you're ready to do something; military, sports, any kind of activity. First two.

What's the other one? Well, this isn't a monkey suit, but it kind of feels like one right now. A "monkey suit" is the informal word for tuxedo. Tuxedo, I'm sure you've seen it, when people go and get married, they wear a fancy, special suit because on this suit they have a bowtie. It's a tie that looks like this, usually used for weddings and formal occasions; big parties. Yeah? So, they call it a monkey suit because... I'll explain. Even though it's formal clothing, it's like a uniform because all the men wear the same thing. They will usually wear a white shirt with a black jacket, a cummerbund, which is this thing they put around their waist, here. Okay? And black pants and black shoes. And all the men wear it, so that's why they call it a monkey suit, because they're all doing the same thing. But we also sometimes call uniforms monkey suits. If someone works as a cleaner, they might say: "This monkey suit", because it's not... I'm not... I don't feel human; I feel like one of a group, just a uniform body of people. Okay? "Uniform" meaning the same.

"Bathing suit". If you wear a bathing suit, it's not when you take a bath. I know, you think shower, you think bath. A bathing suit is something different. When you go swimming, that's when you wear your bathing suit. So when you go to the ocean and you're out there, you're not in your birthday suit - no, you can't go naked. But you can put on a little thing, it looks like little underwear. And some girls, their bathing suit is a "bikini", that's a two-piece bathing suit, or it can be a one-piece bathing suit. All right?</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from EngVid. We are gathered here today for this thing called "life". That's a line from Prince. And I have to apologize because one of you out there said that my song was not music from Star Wars, but from Mozart. My apologies. But I'm still using it because it sounds, you know, like something horrible is about to happen, and it is. I'm going to teach you a lesson on weddings. And depending on who you are, it's a good thing or a bad thing. But anyway, here we go. One of the things we're going to talk about -- we'll talk about the rituals of weddings, and I'm going to give you some vocabulary to go with that. And just to start off the show -- I don't know who this guy is, but anyway. He's saying, "Will you marry me" to this beautiful young girl. And she's saying, "Yes. I will. Is that a diamond ring" -- another word for "wedding band" -- "or Mr. E?" We'll find out.

Let's talk about weddings. Okay? Well, before we go there, here's a little joke I'd like to put to you. There are two things you will be invited to. And both of them signal the death of something or the death of life. Okay? The first is a funeral. And I did a video on that earlier. Go find it. That's where my friend corrected me. And the second one is a wedding. It is the death of your single life. So what we're going to do is I'll do the magic click, take a step out, and then we're going to start the lesson. Are you ready? Let's go on our journey.

"And dearly departed" -- sorry. Marriage. I keep forgetting because that death thing keeps coming to my mind. Anyway. So what we want to look at is -- I told you I would give you some vocabulary and explain a little bit, give you a little history. It's not too much, but it will help you to remember and understand why we do what we do. Ready? Let's go to be board.

Mr. E is gone, but his presence will not be missed. Okay in fact, I'll put a little E here. We're going to talk about the engagement. Okay? There you go, Mr. E. He's not looking too happy about being in this particular situation. We say the wedding is a particular day, and it's true. In fact, there are special names for weddings when you're getting married. But before that we've -- I consider the wedding starting with the engagement because that's the first time you make a promise to join -- look at that. Engagement. You get a ring. Surprise, surprise. You get that engagement ring, and you say, "Will you marry me?" The person says yes. You put it on. Boom. You're fiancés. You've started the first step to getting married.

A little thing about wedding rings. I'm not sure if you know about it, so I'll just take a good look at it. Do you know what this symbolizes? Well, boys and girls, in the old days, the wedding band -- that's another word for "wedding ring", the "wedding band" -- the wedding ring told other men that this woman was taken. So when the woman would put it on, other men would go, "Oh, no she's off the market." In other words, "You can't date her anymore because somebody else has bought the woman." Glad those days are over. Yeah? You just bought a diamond ring, son. It's not over. So engagement. It starts with a ring. And just before the wedding, people -- you know, these are old, kind of rituals or things we used to do. Young people would get together. They wouldn't have anything. They might have lived on a farm. So they needed to get things to start their new life together, and not everyone had a lot of money. We're talking of the times where people were kings and queens and princes. So the poor didn't have a lot. So when you would have a bridal shower or a stag night, well, the bridal shower was to get gifts to help the couple start their new life together. I mean, really, this is about 150 years old, but it's still long because you're young, son. Not like me. Okay. So the bridal shower, if you get invited to that, cha-ching! It's the beginning of what I call the "wedding money machine". You have to show up with a gift for the bride because she's starting a new life and you should pay for it. That's right. Unlike the bachelor party -- old guys call it "stag night" because stags have, you know, the big buck. It's sort of like a horror story -- deer. You know Bambi's mommy? Well, Bambi's daddy would be a stag. He would be big and strong. It would be your final night to be a big, strong man because now, you're about the get married. I love it. One ring shall control them all. Anyway.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Do you know the difference in pronunciation between "question", "queue", and "quay"? English is not a phonetic language, so it can be confusing when a letter is not always pronounced the same way. In this lesson, you will learn three ways to pronounce the QU sound in English. To help you understand these differences in sound, you will also hear about the history behind the way we pronounce modern English. Did you know that the origins of the English language come from a combination of German, Greek, and Latin? Watch this video to learn more!

TRANSCRIPT

To be or not to be? That is the kestion. "Kestion"? I thought it was supposed to be "question". Hi. James, from EngVid. This is a lesson on pronunciation. I have many students, especially from the Asian region. They'll say, "kestion, Teacher. What is the kestion?" And I don't blame them because they see the QU and they think it's a K sound because in other parts of the world, QU is a K sound. But at the beginning of the word, it's different. Now, today I'm going to help you with learning how to pronounce it, but I'm going to tell you why. So you're going to get some history. And this is why I give history, to make it memorable. Because once you understand something and you can remember it, you can use it. Cool? Let's go to the board.

So Mr. E was saying, "Is it a 'kestion' or a 'question'? I have a 'kwa' sound." Okay? Or why does the Q sound like "kwa"? Why do we have the "kwa"? Right? "Queen", "quake", "quail", all "kwa", obviously. Right? Well, English today is not a phonetic language. It's not. All you have to ask yourself -- do you live on a farm, or do you go to the pharmacist, and spell it, and you'll go, "That's kind of crazy." And it is.

There are two main reasons for this. And I'm going to give you a little bit of English history. So let's go to the book of English. Many pages. All blank. Okay. So history, because I want to give you a little bit of history. Now, English is actually made up of four language groups. Basically, the first group of English, which is -- and the reason why I'm looking here is because I actually have the percentages. Okay? The first group of English were really German. It was a Germanic language, hence "Anglo-Saxon". Okay? And that accounts for about 30 percent of our language. Do you know that? Sorry, 26 percent of the language is actually German because the first people were German speaking. Now, there was a time called the Dark Ages when knowledge was lost, and people, you know, they didn't communicate because Rome had fallen. Remember, Rome was Latin. That's another part of our language. And it was kept by the religious people. Right? They had all the knowledge, and they would spread it. When you went to school, they would teach people. So Latin became the technical language and the scientific language, all language of ideas. All the? And the German was the language spoken by the common people. Well, a kind of German. It was different from the German that we speak or German spoken today.

Now, Greek is because, you know -- Greek and Latin languages, they were, actually, kind of close. From way back, there was a time where there was an exchange. So we have a little bit of Greek. Okay? In fact, that is where our alphabet comes from. A, B, C, as easy as alpha, beta, kappa, delta, epsilon. A, B, C, D, E. There you go. Greek influence on our alphabet. I'm giving you all of this for a reason that you'll understand that why certain sounds which seem crazy make sense. And it's going to be the Latin and Greek connection.

The final part is -- we have the French come in. So why am I telling you this? I told you there were two reasons. No. 1, if you have four languages coming together, you can't have rules -- like, hard rules -- because the languages have different rules. Okay? Second of all, it's going to explain to you why this weird sound comes up in the first place. Part of, you know, the Greek and the Latin rules together, they created this Q sound in our language. The second main reason English isn't phonetic -- simple. It was until people wrote it down. What? When we say a language is phonetic, we say, basically, what's written, how you write it is how you say. Well, before, English was what we call codified. When people used to spell things like "cow", they would spell it like this, "kow", and it was okay because only Johnny in Johnny's town wrote it this way.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James, from EngVid, and I'm showing you my hand. It's handy for a reason. Now, I did a video earlier on on hands with idioms, just idioms. So go check that out. Fun one. It's rather handy. But this video is a little different. It's going to be, sort of, beginner, intermediate -- and I'll explain -- simply because the first couple of minutes, Mr. E and I are going to explain the parts of the hand. Now, you can skip it if you want and just keep watching and go, "Oh, my god. They don't know." But really, sometimes, people don't know. I've had students walk up and go, "Teacher, you do this. What is this?" I go, "It's not your foot toe. It's not your toe finger. It's something else." Okay? They have names, and we're going to work on them right now.

So the hand -- there. Okay? And we're going to look at the hand and the parts. To start off with, you have a thumb. This is this part, you know, the cool one. You've got your index finger. "Index" because we use it to point at things. That's why the other name is "pointer". Right? Sometimes, we call it "pointer" because we point over or indicate or index. Okay?

Next one is the middle finger. It's this finger. I can't show it on camera. And if you're 18, you can take a peek, but there. Okay? It's your index finger -- sorry. Middle finger. Once again, the middle finger. Right? And that's it. So it's the middle one. I'll explain what that's for. And the ring finger. Right? You put your rings on this one. It usually indicates marriage, funny enough. You're married or you're single. If you have a finger -- finger. Hopefully you've fingers because you're typing on the computer. But if you have a ring on this finger, on the left hand, it usually means marriage in Western culture. And then, you've got the baby finger, the pinky finger. You know? Dr. Evil finger. I will finger you with this. No, I won't.

And what about the rest of the hand? Because these are the fingers, so you know. But then, you've got that back of the hand. I call it the business hand. When someone is giving you a problem, you go, "You want the business hand or the friend side?" Speaking of which, this is the palm. The palm is the inside of the hand. Okay? And the back. So we've got that. Now, it's not part of the hand, but very important is the wrist because the wrist is where the hand connects to the rest of our body. Cool?

And doctors like this part. On your wrist, you can find your pulse. That's your heartbeat. It's all in your hands, son. It's all in your hands, your whole life. Cool? All right.

So Mr. E is just demonstrating. You know? He blew it up so you could take a look at what his hand looks like. All right? Now, these are called "fingers", by the way. I know. Because you're going, "We have all these names, but what do I call all of them together?" We call them "fingers". And before I nail this one, do you -- see? Fingernail. Your fingernails. Your fingernails -- each one has a little thing here. It's called your "fingernail". All right? So you've got fingernails on your fingers. And your forefingers plus your thumb -- the thumb is separate. That's why I put these in blue. The thumb is not considered a finger. It's considered just a thumb. Your fingers plus your thumb make up your hand with your palm, the business end -- the back of the hand. Right -- and your wrist. You ready? Let's learn how to use these things, shall we? Let's take a look -- a walk. I'm just going to -- there we are. That was fast. Didn't need to do that, did I? I should've just turned around. Oh, well.

Okay. So first thing I want to point out in this lesson, "somebody" and "something". "S/b" like this stands for "somebody". It's found in most dictionaries for people learning English and people who speak English. That's what it means when you see it. And "sth" like this means "something". Just shorthand. Small, quick way to write "somebody" or "something", so you know what it means.

Now, we talk about fingernails, the smallest part of your hands. So why don't we start with that? When somebody tells you they're "hanging on by their fingernails", it means they're barely surviving. It's almost like everything is going to go away, and they're just barely alive.</media:description>

<media:description>Good pronunciation is essential to sounding like a native English speaker. Because words don't always sound like they are spelled, it can be confusing to learn how to say them correctly. But don't worry. There are rules to help you understand how to pronounce them. In this lesson, you will learn three different ways to pronounce the EX sound in English. Do you know the pronunciation difference between "excellent" and "exact"? Watch this lesson, and find out.
http://www.engvid.com/3-ways-to-pronounce-ex/

TRANSCRIPT

Oh, E. You didn't expect your ex-girlfriend to do that, did you? Wow. That's nasty. Here's the problem. This isn't how you spell "expect". And this isn't how you spell "ex-girlfriend". But this is how you pronounce it. So today's lesson is on pronunciation. How to pronounce the EX in English. It seems easy. X, here. But really, what happens is when the X comes in certain, you know -- how do I explain?  I'll do it this way. English is what we call a "stress time language". And what that means is we stress certain parts of our language. So we make some parts of the language stronger than others. You might think, "Why is this important?" Well, most other languages are syllable stressed. And a "syllable" is basically a vowel sound with some consonants, and the words are joined this way. Okay? But in English, we don't really care about the sound of the syllable as much as we do about the stress on the words. And because of that, when we do stress, it helps us figure out what is a verb, what is a noun, what is an adverb, and what is an adjective, and what we call "functions", like prepositions and, you know, pronouns. We can tell the difference by the stress on the words. Easy? Good.

So this is why I have to mention this because that will explain why these things change. The stress in English depends on -- where we say the X is depending on the sound it makes. Remember what I said? Stress in English tells us if it's a thing or a verb or a describer, an adjective, or an adverb or a function. And we have this here to help us figure out which one is which.

There are a couple of rules I'm going to give you in a second or two. I'm going to go to the board and look at that. But one thing I'm going to say now and at the end is please remember that English is a global language, and not all the English in England is the same as in Canada or the same as America or Australia. So some of the words, you'll go, "Well, we say it like this."  I'm like, "Yeah. You do. But we say it like this."  It doesn't make it wrong. It's just to remember. And that's why I usually say I make 80 percent rules. 80 percent of the time, nobody cares because it's basically right. So those of you with your books going, "Well, I read the Merriam dictionary, and it said this."  You're right. You got me. So what? Okay? Because the other dictionary says something else. All right? So this is to basically help you understand that this is how you can understand what we're doing. You don't have to be perfect, but you can understand what we're saying and copy it. And to help make it easy for you to learn these things. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

Boom. I'm a new X-Man. Mr. Disappear. See? X-Man? Get it? Anyway. Let's go to the board, all right?

So to help us figure out whether it's "eks", "iks", or "egz", I'm going to give you a couple of, well, three little grammar rules that are quick and you can follow that will be helpful to you.

No. 1, if the first syllable -- that's why I made it No. 1, because I'm smart like that -- is stressed or -- please remember this part; it's very important -- or if it's followed by a consonant, we're going to see "eks". Okay? So you've got your "ex" plus "con". So in the first two cases we, have "extreme" and "expand". Okay? So we're looking at is a consonant here, okay? And you know, we're not talking about the stress in the syllable here. We're just talking about the fact that there's a consonant following. Cool? All right.

But if we look at "excellent", we do say, "This is excellent work."  We say the "ex"  first. Is similar to "X-Men" where we really put the stress on the first part. So the first syllable is stressed. So you have, "Excellent work."  But nothing to the extreme. Right? So you have the second stressed, but we're saying really what we care about is there's a consonant following the "ex". Good? All right. That's the first one.

Now, let's look at the second one. See? Smart guy, again. Second syllable, No. 2. I work at this. I'm a professional. Don't try this at home. Okay? The second syllable is stressed. So we look at "expect", "exclude", and "external". All right? And because of that -- see what we've got here? We say -- the second syllable, it becomes "iks". "Ikspect", "iksclude", and "iksternal". Right? We don't know "EXternal". It's "external". "It's an external thing."  "He's excluded."  All right? "What do you expect?" Not "expect". "What do you 'ikspect'?"</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Man, that car goes so fast. I'd like one, but, you know, because I don't have the money right now, I -- hi. James, from EngVid. I'm looking at some serious automobiles. They are so cool, and they go so fast it's incredible, you know? $50,000 -- I thought so. It's more money than that. Anyway. Today, we're going to do a lesson on "because" and "so". The reason why is because a lot of students get confused with -- and I love the word "confused", so let's change that to a lot of students don't understand the difference between when to use "so" or "because", so they generally -- I'm using "so" again -- use "because". It's easier. But today, we're going to learn the difference so you can start using it in your language like a native speaker, okay? Let's go to the board.

"He said I'm fat, so I hit him. Blam!" "I hit him because he said I was fat. Blam!" What's the difference? "Mr. E punched me twice." Right? It hurt. It's still hurting. All right? Do you know the difference between "so" and "because"? I can speak English. Because you're reading the sentence, it seems to be the same thing. I said "fat"; I got hit. Right? Right. But how do we know the difference, and what is the difference? Let's go to the board and look at the grammar to start with. And then afterwards, we'll show examples of how it's different. All right? So you can start using it right away.

First of all, I'm going to start with "because". It's easy. You'll notice a little here -- well, a little here and a lot there. "Because." It's a reason. It's why. So when you use "because", somebody usually says to you why. And then, you say "because". "I am late." "Why?" "Because the train was late." "I am happy." "Why?" "Because I won a million dollars. I am happy --" you got it. Right? It's a conjunction. So what it does is it takes two statements and puts them together. "I did it because it was the right thing." It brings two statements together. Conjunction. "Con" means "with" and "junction", like joint, joined with each other. Right? So it's a basic conjunction.

Now, what we want to look at is "so". Here's where the difficulty comes in because "so" is a conjunction as well. You'll notice Mr. E is holding an arrow -- I'm sorry, a box. And it's saying -- look. They're both the same. They're both conjunctions. They both join statements together. "It was hot, so I bought an ice cream." Right? So you go, "What? You bought an ice cream?" "Yeah. I bought an ice cream. It was hot, so I bought an ice cream." Cool? So when you're doing that, you're joining it together just like the conjunction for "because". Cool?

And that's what caused the problem: They're both conjunctions. But "so" answers a different question. When you say the reason or you answer "why" for "because" -- "I am fat because I eat too much food." -- this is the reason. "So" is more of a result. What happened? Okay. "It was raining very, very, very, very hard, so I got wet." "What happened?" "Well, it was raining really hard." "What happened?" "I got wet." "Oh." You could say this is the reason, and that's why they're conjunctions. But then, "so" goes on to telling you what happened, the next thing that happened, the next step. It doesn't always give you the reason for it. Right? "He ate dinner at seven o'clock, so I had dinner at 7:30 because I was hungry, too." Notice I said "because". That was the reason. But I said this happened, this happened, and the reason was because I was hungry, too. I've taken them and joined them together to show you a little bit of a difference. This is like action to action. And this is why the action happened. All right?

There's another difference with "so" that I like. That should help you with them. "So" is also an adverb. We use it to show the extent or the range -- how far it is. I'll give you an example. You know me. "James talks very fast." You can also say, "James talks so fast, half the time, I can't understand him." And you'll go, "Why?" "Yeah. He talks so fast." And that tells me the range. What we have here is verb plus "so". And that's how we show the adverb, how it works together. Okay? Right. Or, "She looks so good tonight." "She looks so good" is a big range. She looks really good. Smashing. Right?</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Straighten that spine! Stand up straight! Imperatives. Welcome. James, from EngVid. If I seem crazy, I was giving orders, sir! Okay? An "imperative" is a command. I mean, we have statements in English. We have questions. You know, we've done lessons on those. An imperative is usually a command. I'm going to give you a quick primer, or quick lesson, on imperatives. Nothing special. And then, I want to do something a little different. I want to show you how to modify it. So let's look at imperatives.

What is an imperative? As I said, it's a command. You tell somebody to do something. You do not ask. You just tell them and expect it to be done. "Shut up. Sit down. Get out." That's it.

Next, how do we make an imperative? Well, when I said, "Shut up. Sit down. Get out", you notice the verb is in the infinitive form minus "to". There is no "to". "I have to", "got to" -- nothing. Just the verb -- or you could say "base form". Right? No particle "to".

Next, an imperative, when given, it's in the second person. I know not everybody understands the second and third person, so I'll be quick, but hopefully easy. I'll make it easy for you. First person is "I". I am the first person. You speak about yourself. The third person is when you talk about groups and others. Right? "They" or "them" or "we". The second person is a strange one. It's "you". Well, sometimes, you want to say to someone, like, "You can do this. You can do that." That's the second person because I'm speaking to someone directly, and that's you, you the audience. "You" can be either singular or plural. When we talk about imperatives, we're talking about "you". "Sit down. You sit down." We just don't say it. Right? So when somebody tells you to sit down, really, they're saying, "You sit down." They just don't say it. It's understood. And a command is direct. You cannot interpret -- which means trying to translate or figure it out -- you're just supposed to do it. Right? "Drive slower." Don't try to translate. Just do it. Right?

Now, also, one other small thing. Usually, imperatives are not given with modals. There's a small exception. It doesn't happen often, but sometimes, we use "be able to". But when we use "be able to", it's very specific. Here we go. Okay? Your instructor or coach at the gym might say to you, right, "You need to be able to do 100 pushups tomorrow." "Be able to". It's an order. It's not asking you. It's not "can you do them?" It's, "Be able to read this or recite this tomorrow." You must do it. It's an order. It's the only exception, really, with modals. Otherwise, we don't. And this is rarely used. But I know there are some of you out there who will go, "I heard" -- and I'm telling you. So got you. All right? This is the rare exception. Otherwise, modals aren't used with imperatives.

That's a quick imperative lesson. So we use imperatives all the time. But if you use them -- and I see students doing it regularly -- you offend people because they are strong. They can be rude. I know in many of your cultures, you have a language for politeness. In English, we don't necessarily, but we can modify the imperative to make it more polite. I'm going to show you today a few ways to do that. All right? So let's go to the board.

Private E, stand down. All right? Let's start off with "please", "please and thank you". You hear this all the time. "Please, please, please, thank you, thank you." You know this is polite. Well, how do we use "please" with an imperative, right, to make it soft? Well, one of the first things I want to tell you is when we use the imperative like "sit down", "sit down" is an order. It's not nice. "Sit down!" Right? "Behave!" But if I say, "Please sit down", I'm offering it to you. I'm still telling you what to do, but I'm being polite. So when we really want to be polite but still followed -- right? You still want to do it -- you put "please" at the beginning of the sentence. "Please sit down. Please introduce yourself." If you drop the "please", listen to what I'm saying. "Please sit down." "Sit down." "Please introduce yourself." "Introduce yourself." I'm still saying you must do this, but what I'm actually doing is being polite by saying "please" first.</media:description>

<media:description>English can be really confusing! Many words sound the same, but have different meanings. Some words are even spelled exactly the same way and sound the same way too, and they still have different meanings! Today, I'm going to teach you all about these kinds of words in English, and I'll give you many examples. You'll learn about homonyms, homographs, and homophones. You'll learn a little bit of grammar and some new vocabulary. Learning this stuff will definitely help you to become a better reader and writer of English. Think you know it all? Take the quiz at www.engvid.com, where you can also find many more free English lessons.

TRANSCRIPT

To be or not to be? That is the question. Hi. James, from EngVid. We're looking at homonyms. What are they? Well, before we even go there, why don't we just go to the board for a second? I want to show you something. I'm sure you've heard this before. All right? English people say, "Those four things are for you." Okay. Four, for. How about this? "When you go to the store to buy the milk, swing by John's house and say bye to him for me." Now, a few of these words sound the same, but we know the meanings are not the same. And this is what we mean by homonyms. Okay? But I'm going to give you a little test before we get started on the lesson because I want to do some grammar. Let's look at the board.

So Mr. E who wants to test thee, and he's giving you a little story. Now, bear in mind, when we're finished, at the end of the video or near the end, we're going to come back to this with the proper words and see what you've learned. "I want you to bare with me as I teach you to go on to the hire lessons on EngVid. When you complete the hole video, you will be a much better student because you will no how to read and right like a native speaker." Now, to a native speaker, actually, it's quite funny. What I just said, if they're not looking at the board, it's perfect English. But if you were to actually write this on paper, they would be scratching their heads going, "What is wrong with you?" 'Empty', 'job', 'whole', 'no', and 'correct' don't make any sense. And probably, what I just said to you doesn't make any sense because you're thinking, "Huh? You wrote that, James. You should know." And you're right. And in a second or two, so will you. Ready?

Okay. Ready? Let's do the grammar. Now, what are homonyms? Well, "nym" means "name". Right? We're here. I'm going to go off for a second so that you can see. "Nym" means "name". "Homo" means "same". So it means "same name". But this is a general term. And what we have to look at is not the general term but the individual terms for grammar. Because some teachers may say to you, "This is a homophone or homograph." And you're going to say, "What?" Well, I'll break it down for you.

Homophone. Think your iPhone. Got the iTalk going here. "Phone "is for sound, right? Because we have "phonics", sounds. So what we have here is a homophone sounds the same, but it's spelled differently and has a different meaning. "Bare" and "bear". Right? In the story earlier, we talked about "bare", and it didn't look quite right? You were right because I was using a homophone. Okay? But it also could be a homograph. What? Too many words. We're going to simplify. You know what a graph is, right? It tells you how things are moving. Usually, graphs are written, right? So "graph". And we come to -- in English, we say "graphic". "He had graphic speech", which means, "He was saying something, or it was written very strongly." So written the same -- a word can be written the same, but it has a different meaning. "Bear" and "bear" -- notice this one's a noun, and this one's a verb. In case you're confused because I used the same thing over and over, why don't we just look over here. That might explain it to you. Okay.

So we're looking over here. We've got "bare". The first "bare" is "not covering" or "no covering". If this is my bare arm, you will see there is no shirt. It's bare. I won't take the rest off and go bare because this is for children. This isn't an adult video. It also means "open to view". If I say, "My life is bare, laid bare", it means it's open. Anyone can look at it. If you have bare cupboards at home, there's nothing in them. Okay? They're empty. No covering. There's nothing inside. It's empty.

When we look at "bear", it's almost the same, but this one's an adjective. But when we say "bear" as a verb, it means "to support". Well, you have, let's say, a wall. And you have a table. Okay? This is your table. If I put this on it, this is having a hard time supporting it. See? The table is not really stable. Once I put this on it, it cannot bear the weight. It will break. So when we talk about support and we say "bear" -- "Can it bear this?" -- it means, "Can it take the weight? Is it strong enough?" That's "bear" as a verb. Okay?</media:description>

<media:description>Do you want to communicate better? Understand how people think? Find the best ways for you to learn English? In today's lesson, you will learn about the different ways in which people think. By understanding how people think, you will learn how to communicate with them effectively. There are three basic communication styles: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. I will teach you how to figure out what style of speaker a person is, and teach you how to speak with each type. Make sure you understood the lesson by taking the quiz. This lesson will not only help you with your English, but with all your communication! http://www.engvid.com/conversation-skills-whats-your-communication-style/

TRANSCRIPT

Oh, poor E. Hi. James, from EngVid. You know, people see the world differently. We all do. I mean, what sounds good to you may not feel right for other people. And we also learn differently. What I want to do in this lesson today is teach you how to communicate more effectively. I want to teach you the three styles that people have when they communicate, how they communicate, and how you can use these styles -- understanding your own -- to learn English more effectively. Let's go to the board and take a look, shall we?

We've got Mr. E. He doesn't seem to be so good today. Professor E, or whoever this guy is with the funky glasses, right? Like a doctor. Like Freud. "So how do you feel about it, Mr. E?" Mr. E says, "I don't like how it sounds. It just feels wrong." I can't see myself doing it.

Now, each one of these things, they're different styles. There's a word called "modalities", which is a way of seeing or learning things, right? Modes, models. Now, he's talking about different ones. Sounding is for hearing. Feeling could be your hands or your body -- how does it feel? And seeing -- your eyes. We're going to look over here, now. And I'm going to give you the titles or the proper names we say when we talk about these things, okay?

So when we talk about a person who is "visual", we mean they see -- with their eyes, of course. But what we're talking about is when they're thinking, they see pictures or movies. When you ask them a question, a picture appears in their eyes right away. When you say "the large, black dog", they see a dog, a large, black one. They tend to be like me -- they speak quickly. That's why I'm slowing down now. But you say something to me -- I see a picture, and I want to get it out of my head as quickly as possible because pictures are like a thousand words. Okay?

Now, they like things to look good. Why am I telling you this? Well, if you understand how these people think, you'll understand how to communicate with them, right? So a visual person likes things looking good. They speak quickly, and they see pictures when they're speaking. That's why they speak so quickly to you or rapidly. Okay?

What about an auditory person? "Auditory" comes from "audio". You know, your MP3 player? You like music? That's auditory -- with your ears. These people need clear speech. What that means is what I'm doing now is best for an auditory person. They need to hear clearly what you're saying or they don't understand you. It's not such a bad thing. We should all be a little bit more clear in our speech, especially when learning a language. They also need to manage sound level. What would happen is if I'm talking and they're talking and several people are talking, they're the people most likely to say, "Hey, guys. Shh! Calm down. Lower the volume." Because they can't concentrate because they need that clear speech. Okay?

And what's the third thing we're going to talk about? Well, body. It's called "kinesthetic". Sometimes, that includes taste -- delicious! -- and smell. Okay? These people need really slow speech because they feel with their body. So the slow speech helps them to process the information, okay? They like to do things. They are what we call "hands on". They want to touch something or move something. They understand things when they're doing it. If you draw a picture like you would for the visual person, it won't make as much sense. And even if you just speak to them, they won't get it. But as soon as they touch it, they understand it. Okay? They like comfortable environments, something that makes them feel comfortable.

So in each category or sense, these people like things to look good -- the visual ones. These people like to make the sounds nice for them. And these people like to be comfortable in their environment. The nice heat. The right chair. Okay?

How does this help you with your English? Well, this isn't a beginner lesson. What we want to look at is how people learn and how we can speak to them so that your messages are understood more readily. Also, I'm going to show you how you can use it to help yourself learn. Are you ready?</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

[Sings] By no means, binomial -- hi. James, from EngVid. Today's lesson is going to be on expressions. Well, I want to do something on expressions. And it's rather interesting that these expressions are different. You'll notice number one, all the expressions I have here are joined by a conjunction. A conjunction is usually "and", "but", or "or". And a conjunction puts two things together. You'll also notice that there are two different types of them. There are sound patterns, and synonyms. And the third thing that we have to do, too -- it's a lesson on "two" it seems, right? These patterns are sometimes called "binomials". And you're probably going "bi what?" I don't blame you. But to make it easy, remember I've been speaking about two? "Bi" means "two" in English. "Bicycle", right? "Bifocals". "Nomial" just means "name". "Name", right? So "name" or -- I should say, "word". So basically, a binomial is two words. And what we're going to work on today is, well, expressions with two words.

Now, in English, there are a couple of them. There are actually four, but I'm only going to do two today. We have -- the first one I'm going to work on is sound patterns. "Sound patterns" means when you say it, they kind of sound similar. "Odds and ends", "prim and proper", "wine and dine", "part and parcel". They kind of rhyme a little bit, or they have, you know, a similar type of sound. So a lot of our sound patterns and binomials, they do have a meaning, and I'm going to explain four for you today so you can make your vocabulary or your expression vocabulary larger. All right? So let's do the first one.

"Odds and ends". What are "odds and ends"? "Odd" means "strange". "End" means "finish". Not in this case. "Odds and ends" means small, unimportant things. So if I ask Mr. E, "Mr. E, can you move the big boxes, and I'll move the odds and ends later?" It means -- I mean, what is this stuff? Just stuff. Just move this stuff later. It's odds and ends. It's odd stuff. It doesn't have a pattern it fits into. Not important. Odds and ends, right?

Now, I like this one. You have to be -- I've got it here again. I'm going to do it if I can. In England, "prim and proper". "Prim and proper". It means "fancy and fussy". Fancy and fussy. Fancy as in, you know, the British like to speak like this. And "fussy" means being very particular about something. So when you say someone is "prim and proper", their shirts will be just -- their shirts will be proper; they will stand with a certain posture like they've got a stick up their bum bum; and they will walk like this and talk like this. "Prim and proper." They will not use contractions like "don't" and "can't". That's not proper. Okay? So if someone says you need to be "prim and proper", they mean you need to be somewhat serious, and you know, do not use those contractions, and act properly. All right? "Prim and proper". A little bit fussy, a little particular, a little snooty, snobby. All right? Yeah.

Okay, what about "wine and dine"? Well, you can wine and dine E and I anytime you wish. Just come to my house -- no. Take me to a fancy restaurant. "Wine and dine." Just think of it this way: "Wine" -- you know you go to a nice restaurant, and "dine" means to eat. When you "wine and dine" someone, it means to entertain. "Come to my place, I'll wine and dine you. I'll entertain you." Simple, right? But it's got that rhyming thing, and it's a little nicer. It rolls off the tongue. All right?

And how about this: "part and parcel". It means "belong to". What? Well, the word "parcel" means a "package". A "part" means -- well, you know what "part" means. There are four pieces; each is a "part". So it's part of a package. Let's do this, okay? So part of a package. So here's a parcel. I'm not exactly the best drawer, right? It's a box. You get a parcel in the mail, yeah? Well, this is a part of that. So when you say "part and parcel", it means it belongs to that. Cool enough, yeah?</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Hi, guys. Welcome to EngVid. I just want to say to you that I have the power. Anybody who watched He-Man will remember this. And if not, oh, well. I've got a lesson for you today, and it's on cleaning. This, my friend, is a vacuum cleaner. Look at it. Elegant lines. [Spits] A little dirty, but we'll clean that up in a second or two when we start the video. This is on a basic lesson for cleaning. There's another video you should check out. It gives more phrases you can use with cleaning. Right? You will like that one, too. But anyway, let's get moving, right?

There we are, over here. Mr. E. Oh, no. He has spilled something. "Spill" -- what is "spilling"? A "spill" is when you have, you know, a liquid, and you drop it on the floor, and it goes everywhere. Sometimes, you can spill things like rice, sugar, or salt because they're uncountable and they go everywhere like a liquid. "He has spilled his tea." The cleaner isn't happy. But I don't think he's using the right tool for this job. Do you? Do you know what this is called? Do you know what he should use? By the end of this lesson, you're going to know that and a few handy phrases to show you are a native English speaker, yeah?

All right. So what's happening in the picture? My friend is cleaning up the spill. But I think he's using the wrong tool. Booyah! "Wipe." The first thing we want to talk about is "wipe". What is "to wipe"? Well, when you "wipe" something, you take a paper or a rag -- you know cloth. Or -- cloth, rag, paper. These are the things we use to wipe. It's a soft movement where you just kind of do this motion or this to clean something. Okay?

Now, we wipe tables, and we wipe walls to clean them. Right? So when something's not serious, you can wipe it. It will go away easily. Right? Unlike my last girlfriend. Anyway.

"Wash", "wash", what is "washing"? Well, you should wash your hands, right, to get them clean. But we also need to wash other things. One of the things we wash is after you eat your food, you have your knife and your fork, right, and a plate. You put them in water. All right? See our little water here? This is a sink. That's where you put them, by the way. Did you know they're called "sink"? This is called a "sink". You put your dishes in the sink, and you wash them. Okay?

So we've got our sink. We also wash our clothes. You're clean, right? I'm sure you don't wear the same clothes all the time. You take them off. You put them in the machine. We call that a "washing machine". Okay? So "wash" -- you "wash" dishes; you "wash" your clothes. And that's what we've got here. Another word for "clothes" by the way, boys and girls, "laundry". A lot of times, we don't say, "I'm washing my clothes." In fact, we mostly say, "I'm doing my laundry", but we'll come back to that. Okay? So you've got "laundry" to wash.

Now, "scrubbing" -- "scrub". "Scrub" -- I'm missing something here. Oops. Pardon me. You scrub, and it's hard. Remember I said when you use a cloth, you use it for soft? "Scrubbing" is when you want to go really, really hard on something because it's hard to clean. Now, what do we scrub? We scrub floors. Okay? You have dirt on the floor. You have to get down there and scrub it. You scrub your sink because remember, you've been washing things. You need to scrub to get the dirt out. It won't come out with a wipe. Okay? There's a lot of dirt there. Please, oh, please, tell me you scrub your toilet. Don't wipe your toilet, okay? You know what you use it for, so you need to scrub that thing clean. Okay? Or don't invite me to your house. Some of you have, but I noticed you only wipe your toilets. I'm not coming. Change that attitude -- change your behavior, I'll be there. Okay? And walls. Walls get dirty. People throw things; food goes on the wall. Especially if you have babies, it goes up on the wall. You need to scrub it because it goes into the paint. Okay?</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Comrades, welcome to EngVid. Today, we will be discussing the hat. Hi. James, from EngVid. I do want to talk about hats. I'm wearing a hat that goes with this shirt. Okay. But I've got a couple of them because we're going to discuss idioms.

Now, Mr. E is here, of course. He's wearing a baseball cap. He's got, you know -- we call them "granddad caps" in England, but they're "caps". You see people wearing them all the time, this kind of a cap. Okay. Cowboy hat, badly drawn, but who cares? In the early 20th century, people wore hats a lot, okay? So a lot of hat wearing. People would wear hats everywhere -- church, whatever. Men would wear hats, so would ladies. But then, they suddenly stopped. If you want to know the truth, it was around the 1960s from a president named John F. Kennedy. He was seen often not wearing a hat, and he didn't wear an undershirt. And after that, men starting changing their style. See? You don't just learn English. We're going to teach you some history. He kind of changed fashion a little bit, for men, for the next 40 to 50 -- well, 60 years. But now, hats are back. And it's time for a hat idiom show, okay? Because now, you can say things. You'll be wearing your hat, and you can say something stylish like, "I take off my hat for you." Okay? So let's go to the board.

You'll see I have a couple of things written here -- well, five, to be exact. Okay? And right now, you don't know what they mean, like, "without hesitation", "Be prepared for something very physical", "Be prepared to be shocked", "give my respect", "I admire them", "keep it a secret", and "have many responsibilities". And I'm sure you're saying, "What does this have to do with hats?" Well, why don't I show you? Ready?

Now, "drop of a hat". When somebody says "at the drop of a hat", they mean "without hesitation. At any time." I'm talking to you, and -- oops. It dropped again. You don't know. It means, "Move now." If someone says, "You have to move at the drop of a hat", it means, "Don't even think. Just go." Or it could happen at any time. "At the drop of a hat, the bus could arrive." So you literally drop your hat; you look down; Whoa! The bus is gone. Just like that. So "be prepared", okay?

What about this one? Have you ever been walking in the wind? It's really, really windy. See this is flying. It's flying away like Superman's cape now. See, it's flying. Someone will say, "Hold on to your hat!" Because it will blow away. Well, if you watch any movies, especially Westerns or North American movies, they're always, like, "Hold on to your hat, son. Something's going to happen." It's saying, "Be prepared to be shocked, or something's going to be bad. Be prepared." Because it's going to be so physical or so amazing that the hat might fly away, and you'll lose your hat. Remember, people were in the 20th century, so they wore hats all the time everywhere. Now, we don't as much, so they don't say it as much, but you're going to see that these idioms are going to come back simply because hats are in style. All right? So, "Be ready to be shocked." Something will scare you, and your hat will fly off your head. Or you're going to do something physical like run, and, "Hold on to your hat! We've got to get going."

Now, how about this? "I give my respect" or, "I admire that person." If I were to see the Queen right now, I would do this. Hat's off. Okay? When we say, "My hat it off" -- "hat's off". Remember, this is from a long time ago. So when you say "hat's off to that person", it's a sign of admiration. Many people, when they go into a church, if they're wearing a hat, they will take their hats off as a sign of respect for the religion. Or, "My hat is off for that guy." I take my hat off because I respect him, so I take it off. And sometimes, people don't do that. What they do is this. You'll see it -- not as much, but they go like this. That's like taking off the hat, so they do it short. And they go like this, "Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, sir." They'll be like, "Good morning." Hat's off to you. "I respect you" or, "You have my admiration" or, "I admire you."

And here's something. I know it's funny money -- whatever. But see this? I've got some money. Don't tell anybody. Keep it a secret. When we say this, "Shh! Keep it under your hat" -- "Keep it a secret." "Keep it a secret. Don't tell anybody." "Shh! Keep it under your hat. Shh! Be quiet."</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Expectation is what we think could or should happen. But COULD and SHOULD are not the same! This important grammar lesson will teach you how to use these modals correctly, like a native English speaker. You SHOULD take the quiz to test yourself!

TRANSCRIPT

What's up, Mr. E? We could be finished in 20 minutes, is that right? Oh, hi. James, from EngVid. Mr. E and I were talking about something. We're having a little disagreement. Well, not a disagreement, but a conversation. I think this lesson could be about five, ten minutes. He said it should be 15. That's a standard lesson length. What's the difference? I don't know. Why don't we go to the board and find out?

If this looks familiar, it should be. This is the -- "it should be". See? This is the second lesson of modals that we're doing. The first one we did was excuses. Yeah? You could've taken that lesson. If you haven't, close this one down; watch that; and come back to this one. This one is actually on expectation. You know? Sometimes, people make excuses for not doing stuff. And other times, our expectations are what we think should happen in the future or could happen. This lesson will help you find out how native speakers use modals in a little different way than you're used to or in the usual grammar setting. Okay? So let's go to the board.

Once again, quickly we'll go over it. What do modals do? Well, modals talk about obligations or possibilities, right? Possibility indicates future. Future. When we talk about what's possible. An obligation is what you should do. So if you mix those together, that's what an expectation is -- is what is possible and what we think people or things should do or happen. Right? Your obligation or the obligation. But let's take a look at this here. Let's go to the board, okay?

First of all, when we talk about modals, which I've just done -- you know, they express future possibility or obligations. Let's look at the verb "to be" or the Be verb. The Be verb is about relative truth. And you're probably going to say to me, "What the hell is relative truth?" Well, relative truth is somebody believes it's true, and it depends where you sit. Right now, you're looking at me, and I'm a tall guy. I'm skyscraper tall. I'm a giant. But only if you're this tall. If you can't see me, it's because I'm a very tiny little man looking up at Big James. Understand? So relatively speaking, if you're this big, anything this big is big. But anything this big, big, big, big, big, big is bigger than this. Understand? "Relative" means it depends on who is looking at it, right? If you're 60, 40 is young. If you're 40 years old, 20 is young. And if you're 10, they're all old, okay? Relative truth. Where do you sit?

So that's what the Be verb means. So once we put a modal, okay, with the Be verb, it changes it. It gives it a different meaning. And what we want to look at now is what does that mean, this change, or how does it change it? And the video before, I mentioned, we noticed how we use it for excuses. In this one, we're going to see how we think the future should be or could be, all right? Let's go.

So what is -- the modal should mean? Well, "should" is what we usually think -- "should" is what is right, okay? We think it is right or probable, most likely to happen, or the correct or right thing to do. That's why we use it as an advice modal. "You should go to school. You should eat your dinner. You should shut up." Okay? We use it as advice. The last one is strong advice. Okay? And "could" is possible. What's possible? You could be talking to me live if you come to Canada. Or you could be dreaming this whole thing. Press reset and see if that's the case. But no. "Could" is what's possible -- possible to happen, okay?

Now, if you add this Be verb to "should", we get this particular thing. See, here's the Be verb because Be is believe, remember? Your perspective; what you believe. "I should + be -- I believe this is right or probable." "You should be a better student. I believe this. And I think it's possible -- probable or right. If you studied harder" -- by saying "studied harder", I think this is what is probable or the correct thing. Right?

But "possible", which is similar, but not the same -- let's not forget -- it's what's possible. "I believe this is possible." "I believe we could be the greatest nation on Earth", says Obama. He should've said something else. Notice I didn't say "should be"; I said "shoulda". Different. Anyway.

So here, we've got what is possible versus what is probable. It seems simple and easy, and it is. So why don't we just use one? And there's a reason for it. Remember, I said this one has "probable" and "right"? And that's with "should"? Well, when people say "should" in English -- like, "you should be" versus "could be" -- what is actually we think is more accurate or more likely to happen.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Fourth dimensional patterns within eternity's monolith wood, he suggests. See, merely -- you probably don't under what I was saying, and I'll tell you the truth. I don't. Hi. James from EngVid. Looking at a Kindle, and I'm going to be using this in this lesson to teach you something. Today, what I'd like to do is help you with saying no in English. Saying no in any language is a very difficult thing to do simply because -- well, there are a few reasons. People want what they want, okay? And they don't like hearing "no". People take it personally. Even though you're saying no to the request, it's usually, "You don't like me. That's why you said no." We all have that, right? And the third thing about saying no is if you keep saying no, it's hard to have good communication because there's a lot of negative conversational energy there. So we want to get rid of that and get rid of that word "no". We're going to -- I'm going to help you today. Why? Because you need practice in conversation so that you can have the best relationships you can have. Right? Right. So what we're going to do is learn how to say no without saying "no" so that you can maintain your relationships and free yourself up a little bit. All right? Let's go to the board.

Nein. Nyet. No. Non. Nada. "Nada" means "nothing". Not quite "no", but you get the drift. All right? So Mr. E's saying no. He doesn't like something. But how can you say no without getting into trouble? Let's go to work, for instance. We're going to go to the board, and we're going to do an example at work. Happens all the time, right? Now, especially if you're a new person learning English, and you're trying to use English on the job, the last thing you want to do is tell your boss, "No." Because you must work hard. This is the job. Okay? You already know this. So let's see how you talk to a superior or a boss and say no.

You're asked to do another job when you have already got a lot of important work to do. So what do you say? How do you get out of this? You don't. You say something like this. "Sure. I can do it. However, I won't be able to do this other thing you want done. Now, which one is more important to you?" Seems simple? It is, and it's very effective, and I'll explain why. This is why it works. First of all you let them choose. When you're saying no to someone, you're kind of taking away power because you have the power to say yes or no. You say no; they lose their power. You're giving it back. I'm saying you have the power to choose what you want. What do you want to do? That's powerful by itself. They feel good. They're like, "I get to choose?"

Next. You're not rejecting the request. To reject means no. I didn't say "no"; I said "sure". "Sure" is the exact opposite of "no". You're saying, "Yeah. I can do it for you. No problem. I'd love to. Problem." But it's not your problem; it's their problem. They have to choose what they want. Okay? You're saying, "You get to choose, but I'm happy to help you either way." I'm saying yes because I'm that kind of person. Right? Also, you're reminding your boss -- you're telling her, you know, that, "Hey, look. I've got other work of equal importance because I've got this job and this job, and you know they're both important you gave them to me. You need to choose and help me here." Right?

So by reminding them of that, you're reminding them that even though you're a foreigner learning English, your work is valuable and so are you and you should be respected a bit. Right? After all, they hired you and they're giving you the work. So I hope you liked that one because you don't spend all your time in the office do you? I don't think so. You have relationships. So the next one I'm going to do is going to help you win your relationships. Are you ready? Let's go there.

Hi. We talked about work. And you have to say no sometimes at work. But you also have personal relationships outside of work. And this one's especially made for that. A lot of times, people offer you things to get you to do things you don't want to do. They're being what we call "sneaky" because they know you would say no, so they offer you something that you have to say yes to. So let's get -- let's use some English to get you out of that trap, shall we.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Trilling and singing. This is for a Tthan Lann from Vietnam who said, "Please don't sing anymore." I just did. Sing, sing, sing. Hi, Tthan. Anyways. Sorry. I don't want to lose this opportunity with you guys. I was lucky; I didn't miss this movie by Chris Evans. Captain America. Great film. Great film. Yeah. I want to do a lesson with you today about "miss" and "loss".

You noticed I used two examples when I said, "I don't want to lose time with you", and "I don't want to miss -- or I didn't miss movie." Why? Because many students make a common mistake of using "miss" and "loss". They might say something like, "I lose my bus today. That is why I'm late." I can't understand why they would say that because in English, "miss" and "loss" mean something similar. It means -- Hey, Mr. E. How are you -- you don't have something. Right? You don't have something. But they come at it from different angles. When I lose something, it means I have less. See? I have less of it, or there's a reduce. Okay? But when I miss something, I don't hit, or I don't connect. The target is here -- "target" is where you're aiming or what you want to hit -- but we move, or we miss, so we do not hit the target. We should go here, but we go here. "You miss." Okay? So there's not a hitting or a connection. So that's the basic lesson we're going to do today. Loss -- oh, sorry. "Lose" and "miss", what are the differences? How are they the same? So you can speak like a native speaker. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

All right. Now, I've talked about basically what they mean. "Miss" means to not hit something, right? Or not make a connection to something. Well, when you lose something, it means you can't find it, it's missing, or there's a reduction. But there's another difference as well. Let's talk about the grammar. We use them differently grammatically. And we're going to work on this now. "Lose." "Lose" is an irregular verb. What that means is it doesn't follow the standard order or the usual way we do things. Add an S -- right? "Lose, loses" -- to the present tense -- ING or ED. It's an irregular verb. So when we talk about the past -- okay? So "lose", the base form, lose is -- oops. Sorry. Before I lose my mind. I think I lost my mind here. "Lose" is as in, "He loses everything." "Lose" -- base form. "Losing" -- when you're in the middle of; present continuous. But the past form is "lost". We change it. It makes it irregular. Okay?

Now, that's the verb form when we use it -- the action. But when we talk about noun, we change this word "lose" to "loss". Okay? Notice the E becomes an S. They're similar in that something you cannot find or do not have anymore. Here's an example of using "loss". "His death was a loss to the company." Notice we use an article to tell you this is a noun. Okay? And he is no longer here. Remember, I said there's a reduction or less of something? So that's what we have with "loss" when we use it as a noun. Now, we're going to go over to "miss", and we're going to look at the grammar for that.

Mr. E is a little confused, but should be finished by now. Okay?

Ready? "Miss" -- it's a regular verb. So "miss", "misses" -- right? So you've got "misses", m-i-s-s-e-s, like "Mississippi", double S here, right? "Missing" and "missed". No problem there. As a noun, unlike "lose", it keeps the same form. So it can be a bit confusing for people because they say "miss" and "miss", and they think, "Oh, noun or verb?" Well, actually, it's easy. We go here. "The new TV program will be a hit or miss." Once again, we've got an article to tell us, so you don't have to worry, really. You just look for the article with this. It's a noun. Or verb; miss watching or miss going, or miss the -- the usual verb endings, and you know it's a verb. Cool? All right.

So we're going to take a second. And magically, I'm going to come back. What's going to happen is we're going to look at the combined differences between "miss" and "loss", and I'm going to clear up that confusion. Ready?

Hey. Did you miss me? I'm back. All right. So the board is changed, and we have to continue our lesson. So we talked about not making a connection when we talked about missing. And then, with "loss", we talked about reduction. Right? So let's go to the board over here. We've got our "lost" over here -- okay? Oh, sorry. "Lose." And we've got over here -- what do we have? We have "miss". Okay?</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Do you know any three-word phrasal verbs? These can be tricky, because sometimes an extra word added to a two-word phrasal verb gives the whole expression a new meaning! These expressions are great to use in an English work environment. Whether you're at work or in school you can use these phrasal verbs to help you get the job done, and to sound smarter while you do it! Take the quiz to make sure you understand these expressions, and subscribe to my channel for many more free English lessons with me and Mr. E! http://www.engvid.com/english-expressions-three-word-phrasal-verbs/

TRANSCRIPT 

Mr. E was just catching up with Mr. Smith when James walked by. Mr. Smith asked Mr. E, "How could you put up with that awful smell of James'?" Mr. E asked Mr. Smith if he could team up with Mr. Jones and come up with a solution for the smell. You're probably going, "What's with this 'with'", right? With, with, with, with, with. Well, I want to talk about phrasal verbs today. I'm sure you've heard of phrasal verbs before. Or you might have heard of them by this other name, "compound verb". A phrasal verb is a two to three-word verb, okay? Some are separable, which means you can take some things off, and the meaning is the same. We'll talk about that when we speak about "team up with". And other ones are not separable or nonseparable, which means you cannot change it or the meaning changes. All right? So let's go to the board and see what Mr. E and Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones -- if you ever watched The Matrix, there is something in there for you. All right? What were they talking about?
Well, I want to talk about phrasal verbs you can use. And these ones, specifically in the work place, and you'll see what I mean. Right? A phrasal verb is funny because by itself, if you just look at it, it doesn't make sense: "come up with", "put up with", "team up with", "catch up with". You mean, "What does it mean?" Because "catch" means this, right? Put means "place". And we look here. When I put the verbs, "come", it basically means when you come somewhere -- arrive or bring. It's a verb. These are all verbs, right? "Put" means "place". You say this, "you put", "place". "Place it somewhere." "Catch" -- sort of like "receive". Okay? And "team" -- oops. Excuse me for a second. And "team" -- "team" is a noun. It's also a verb. But "team" could be teaming -- like, team -- "join". I want to put "bring here, like, "come". Bring, like "bring yourself". You know, they're verbs. They're hard to explain in any simple way. But basically, what this is what they mean.
But as soon as you add particles or prepositions, don't be confused. I use both because, well, all particles are prepositions. But sometimes, prepositions are not particles. Welcome to English. I just teach it. I didn't make the lesson up, okay? So when we add particles -- and a particle is just this. A particle is a preposition that's added to a form, as in a phrasal form verb, and it cannot be changed. So parts -- think of particle as "part" of something. Right? That's it. Prepositions are basically the same. They're "up", "with", "and", "on", "along" -- those are prepositions. But when they are joined with phrasal verbs, we call them "particles" because they have a specific meaning when they're with that verb. Okay? So just remember a particle cannot be separated from the phrase its attached to, and you're good to go.
All right. So what are we going to do with these particular particles, "up" and "with"? Well, let's start off with the story. What did I say -- what was the first thing I said to you? The first thing I said to you was the following: "Mr. E was catching up with somebody." What does it mean to "catch up with"? Well, when we "catch up" with someone, we can, in this case -- catch up -- exchange information. "So what did you do this summer?" "I went to Barcelona." "Really?" "Yeah. It was fun." Just catching up with old times or catching up with old stories.</media:description>

<media:description>Want to join a conversation, but have a hard time getting your turn to speak? In this video, I'll show you two easy ways to join a conversation. I'll show you one dramatic way to steal a conversation, and another way which is more polite. You'll need to use different methods in different situations, so I'll tell you when each method is preferred. Conversations should be about the exchange of ideas, but sometimes it's hard to contribute your opinion. Check this lesson out so you're not stuck holding your tongue when you can add to a conversation! Take the quiz here: http://www.engvid.com/conversation-skills-how-to-steal-a-conversation/

TRANSCRIPT

That's a really good point. And did you consider -- hey, listen. Hi. James, from EngVid. A lot of times, students want to learn conversational skills so they can start a conversation. But when they do start these conversations, they tend to find that they're not included. Today's lesson is how to include yourself. So it's a conversational skill about how to take a conversation or -- yeah. Take your part in a conversation. Are you ready? It's going to be fun. I'm going to teach you two techniques that have two different uses, all right? So you can see here, E is saying, "Wow, Bob. That's a good point, but --". And the second point he says is just, "Listen!" All right? Let's go to the board.



The "listen" one is called a "single-word imperative". All right? Why do we use it? Well, you're in a conversation with somebody, and they're saying things you don't necessarily like, and they're talking, and they're talking fast and loud and being, you know, very demonstrative and showing their hands and talking. And you want to get in there, but you don't know how you can break into the conversation to say something or comment because maybe you don't like what they're saying. You do something like this: [snaps fingers] "Stop." What did I do? I just said, "Stop." One-word imperative. An "imperative" is an order. And the funny thing about the human brain is we've been trained since we were children to listen. Remember when you were running, and your parents would go, "Stop!" Or they would go, "Listen!" Or they would say, "No!" They didn't say sentences; they said one word. So we've been trained for this. But it's very blunt, and we use for children or even dogs. Okay? I'm not saying people are dogs. They're children. But it's very effective because we're conditioned for one-word imperatives. As you get older, we learn to be more polite. So you say, "Listen to me, please. Can you stop saying that, please?" We add politeness. But in a situation where you need to stop someone immediately, the one-word imperative works because it gets right to the point; it gets directly to the person. And what it does is -- look. It draws attention to the intended action. "I don't want you to stop talking. I want the conversation to go, but I want you to stop." Got it? So when I say "stop", you will stop speaking because you're going to be, in your brain, "Stop what? What am I doing?" And that gives an opening for me to come into the conversation. Or, "No." People are like, "No? No what?" Because you don't explain, it raises their curiosity, and they're like, "Why did you want them to stop? Why did you say 'listen'? Why did you say 'no'?" That stop in the conversation allows you to step into the conversation and say what you need to say, okay? See? Stops conversation. Words you can use as examples are "no", "stop", and "listen". And don't explain it. Because when you do say, "Listen to me, please. Listen to me", it's almost like you're saying, "You're not listening. It's not fair" and you're being a baby.



Now, I'm telling you; this is kind of rude. So don't think I'm telling you this is a good way to start friends. That's why I said when you're in a situation where the person saying something you may not agree, like, "All women should not work", you might say, "Excuse me?" Don't say "excuse me"; just say, "Stop." They'll go, "What?" And then you go "boom". You say your part right there. Right? You can say it for almost anything. It's immediate, and it stops action. But it might be considered rude.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Learn some basic words and phrases you can use to talk about cleaning up in English. Do you only have to tidy up a little or is your place a pigsty? In this vocabulary lesson, I'll teach you nine easy phrases you can use to talk about cleaning up. It's time for a little spring cleaning and don't worry -- it won't be a chore! Take the quiz here: http://www.engvid.com/9-basic-phrases-for-cleaning-up/

TRANSCRIPT

[Sings] What the #*$%! Jesus Christ. This place has been -- E! You trashed the place again! It's a disaster area! I'm going to get FEMA in here. Damn it. Oh, hi. James from EngVid. Yeah. A little mess here. E! Excuse me. What the hell. This is my chess set. He's been having -- oh, Arabic coffee. It's the good stuff. E! You've got my Arabic coffee? You made a mess of everything. Oh, God. Listen. This place is a mess. I'm very sorry. It's a pigsty, literally, a pigsty in here. It's totally trashed. I mean, there's no tidying this up. There's no way you can tidy something like -- E, I'm tired of picking up after you, man! I'm tired! Guys, we're going to go to the board. This was going to be about spring cleaning. No. No. It's going to be about clean up after yourself, okay? Let's go to the board. Jesus Christ.

Hi. Welcome to the EngVid disaster area, area, area. I'm not happy. I might seem to be happy, but I'm not. I mean, I just came into work to start. I thought I might do a little bit of spring cleaning, you know? It's getting to be spring. Flowers are coming out and whatnot. And I walk into this pigsty. Let's get started.

Today's lesson is going to be on cleaning -- something you should do at home regularly. Okay? E, clean this crap up. "Crap" means "stuff" -- not a nice word to use, but "stuff". It's actually another word, but you get the idea. Clean this crap up. So we're going to work on eight different phrases for cleaning your house.

We're going to start off with a negative because right now I'm in a negative mood. Then, we'll move to a more positive frame of mind, okay? So let's clean up a little bit.

So the first one we're going to start with, okay, is a "pigsty". A "pigsty". Oink! Oink! Oink! It's where pigs live. If you know anything about pigs, pork, bacon -- Mmm! Delicious! They don't live in a very nice environment. There's lots of mud. "Mud" is earth and water mixed together. Okay? It's very dirty. When we say, "Your room is a pigsty", we're saying, "Your room is messy." Right? Not organized and dirty. You go, "Ew! It's dirty." Okay? And messy. Everything is everywhere. That's a pigsty. Think of a pig -- oink! Oink -- -or your local policeman, and that's what you've got. Okay?

"Trashed", I like this word. You can hear lots of noise because I'm really stepping on things. "Trash", in North America means "garbage". It means "garbage". When somebody has "trashed" your house, it means they -- like, throwing everything everywhere. Usually, a house gets "trashed" for two reasons. That's why it's on the negative clean list. No. 1, "Party man! Woo! Party!" People are drinking. They get drunk. They drop things. They break things. They kick things. You come home. "My house is trashed! My house is garbage because people have put everything on the floor like it's garbage." It's terrible.

"Pigsty", by the way, is usually for a room. We usually say a room is a "pigsty". "Trashed" could be your whole house. Right? The whole house. They trashed my house or my office.

Now, another reason something may be trashed is a break-in. What? If somebody comes into your house to steal, usually they will throw everything down looking for things. Okay? So they will trash your house and throw everything everywhere. Now, remember: "Trash" and "pigsty" are similar, but a little different. "Pigsty", we're talking about dirt. There has to be dirt everywhere. It's dirty. "Trashed" means disorganized, but seriously disorganized. Maybe dirty, but mostly things are everywhere. Okay?

So a break-in, which is a criminal comes into your house. Or you can just trash your office or apartment looking for things. "He trashed it looking." It means you threw everything everywhere. Okay? So maybe you're searching for something. You might end up trashing your room or your files.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

[Speaks Russian] Hi. James, from engVid. I'm not Russian. I'm just practicing it. I was thinking of traveling. Maybe Ecuador. Perhaps Russia. Beautiful ladies there. And when I thought about it -- I mean, let's face it. Nobody wants to be stuck in one place, right? For your whole life. You're an international person trying to learn an international language, which is English. And you know -- hey, you know what? Let's do idioms on the face. I said, "Let's face it." I'm going to talk to Mr. E, and we'll get the lesson started. Okay? Idioms of the face, face, face, face. Take that, Madonna. All right.

So what have we got, E? All right. Well, we talked about "let's face it", but we'll come back to that in case you're wondering what that is. Let's start with No. 1. And where's No. 1? The nose. Le nez. The nose. What about the nose? Well, the nose, you bring in air. You bring things to yourself. The stuff of life, right? So if you know something which is good, which is air -- I find air to be very, very good. In fact, necessary, you might say. I want this -- you're going to have a "nose for value". Why? Oxygen is necessary for life, or you die. When we say someone has a "nose for value", it means they know what the good stuff is. They know what is good, and they know what is valuable. So if you have a "nose for value", you know a good deal, a good bargain, or you know something good when you see it. Right? All right.

And here's the other thing. Remember? I said breathing. By the way, you like this? I look good today, yeah? Anyway. Back to work. "Pay through the nose". Oxygen is the stuff of life. If you don't breathe, you die. So sometimes, we talk about "paying through the nose" when something is too expensive. You pay too much for it. Yes, oxygen is important, but I also need my blood and my heart and my brain. So we say "to pay through the nose" is to pay too much for something or pay very -- you know, pay a lot of money for something. You don't really want to "pay through the nose". That's an expensive way to pay. Okay? So we did nose.

What's the next one we're going to do? He is a man of little brain. That's a brain, in case you don't know what that is. Or the brain is the physical part. That's the thing they can put their head in and take out of you. But we usually say, "I think in my mind. My mind. My mind is where my ideas come from." Okay? So when we say something like this, "a lot on her mind", it means you're thinking a lot about things. "I have a lot on mind." I'm going to give you a free idiom. Free. Okay? This one is "a lot on my plate", which is "a lot to do". But shhh! That's another one. So "a lot on my mind" means I have a lot of thoughts going on in my head. Okay? So -- and it's not quite the face or the head, but look. It's inside your head. Your face is here. Your brain is here. So if you have "a lot on your mind", it means you have a lot to think about. All right? You've got to make dinner; you've got to study at EngVid -- I mean you're a very busy person. And I'm impressed by you. All right. Next.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Do you make spelling mistakes? Spelling in English CAN be easy. You just have to know the rules. In today's lesson, I will show you two basic rules about doubling consonants when changing words. You'll also learn how to say these words correctly. Practice these rules with me on our whiteboard, and then take our quiz to make sure you understand. http://www.engvid.com/basic-rules-to-improve-your-spelling/

TRANSCRIPT

To be or not to be? [Laughs] Spelling bee. In North America, we have this competition called "spelling bee". It's where children take words -- adults give children words, long words, and the children have to spell them correctly. Now, if you're from Saudi Arabia or Japan or Korea or other countries, right now, you're going, "Oh, my God, no!" Because you have to do this in English, and your alphabet is not ours. Latin speakers tend to go, "Oh, we'll do very well", and you're bad as well. And you want a secret? I'm bad at spelling. So just share it between you and the other hundred thousand people watching this, okay? So I'm bad at spelling. You're bad at spelling. But I have to teach the rules at school, and I do. I actually do. And if you ask me something, I'll tell you the rule. But you might catch me spelling it incorrectly. So this lesson is for you and for me. And I call it Spelling 101.

English is not a phonetic language. It makes it very difficult to learn how to spell. So I'm going to give you English or Spelling 101, which are two little rules that will help you spell when dealing with English vowels. "The long and the short of it", I like the call this lesson. It's a joke in there. The long and the short. Whatever. Okay. Let's go to the board.

Are you hoping -- and "hope" is when you pray. You know? You say, "Please let me win the lottery. Really. I want to win the lottery. Please let me win the lottery. Please let that beautiful girl think I'm nice. Please let me pass the test. I hope. I hope. I hope. I wish. I pray." Or are you "hopping"? Are you hopping, like boink, boink, boink? Like a little bunny rabbit. Are you hopping? You notice one has a P, and one has two Ps. Some of you would have written this because you'd say, "Well it's more than 'hope'. It's long, right?" Because "hop" looks like this, h-o-p. "Hope" looks like this. And anybody from a natural language would probably say, "Well, E -- this must be the correct one." I would think so. It's the longer word. But not in English, no. We don't work like that. The shorter word gets it, and the longer word gets this. When I was I kid, I was always told: Short words, you double it. That's what it was. Okay. It made sense. But there's something a little more to it, and today, I'm going to make it easy for you.

Now, there's a lesson that has been done called "The Magic E". Go check that out. That will help you -- you know, it's a longer lesson that gives you more examples. But just to give you an idea of long versus short, okay? The magic E states this: If you have -- let's look over here. "Wipe", for instance. This is an I, a long vowel sound. There's a consonant and then, an E. If the E is on the end of a word, you have a consonant and then, a long vowel sound. Okay? The E actually causes it to be "wipe", not "wip". Right? So here's how we change it. Because we know this E helps to modify this, we have to drop the E. Okay? Because it's actually silent. You think "wipe", so it looks like this. That's what it looks like. "Wipe", not "why-ppe". Sorry, people from Brazil. No "why-ppe". No "why-ppe" here. Okay? That's part of the problem. Nobody tells you this stuff. But I do. Okay. So it's not "why-ppe" or "ray-tte" or "ho-ppe", just "hope", "rate", and "wipe".

Now, the magic E helps us because we see this, and we know it's a long vowel sound. Yay! But when we're adding is it like, "wipes" or "wiping", "rate" or "rated", hoped or hoping, we have to drop that E. We're told, "Drop the E." It's silent. It's not doing anything, anyway. It's like your unemployed brother in your basement. He's not doing anything. Get rid of him. So "wipe" becomes "wiped" or "wiping". Drop the extra E. Not "wipeed". All right? "Rate" becomes "rated". Oops. Sorry. It becomes "rated". Just add the ED. Or "hoping", in the case up there, it becomes "hoping". We get rid of the extra E. We know it's the long vowel because there's only one consonant. Right? One consonant. One consonant. So we know this must be "wiped", "rated", "hoping". It could even be "hoped". "I hoped you would come." Okay? Don't double the consonant. Don't add two E's. It's just single, single. Easy? Easy. The magic E. Now, we know how it creates a sound. And now, we know how to change it. That's the long of it. The long vowel. You like that?</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Okay, so take the bus here, then, the train. Get a ticket -- hi. James, from EngVid. Ever tried finding a place or going to a new country, looking at the subway or transportation maps to get from one place to another? If you look at those things, they're called maps, right? It will tell you what the city looks like, where you can get a bus at what time. But basically, it tells you what something looks like, and it gives you a picture of it. And it may not be an exact picture, but it's generally a picture you can work with. One you can go, "Okay, I'm here, and I want to get here, and that's how I'll do it." Maps are very effective and very efficient, right? Now, "effective" means they get the job done, and "efficient", they do it in a quick way. Why am I talking about maps? In many of the videos I do, you'll see what I call mind maps. I may not have called them mind maps, but that's what they are. A "mind map" is a device or a tool that we use to help us understand something and memorize it. I primarily -- and "primarily" means "mostly" -- use it for vocabulary, but you could use it for grammar; you could use it for learning an entire topic in a foreign language, and in this case, it's English. What I want to do today is explain what it is. For those students who have a problem thinking it's different or confusing, I want to break it down or break it into smaller parts so you can see it, understand it, and then use it yourself in studying English. You like that? Let's go to the board.

I'm looking for Mr. E. And here he is. You are here. He's here on a map, but I don't know where, and I want to get to there. So I'm going to use this to help me figure out where he is. And we're going to use mind maps now to learn how to work with our English.

The first thing you have to understand about a mind map is -- think about getting engaged. [Sings] I know. That's the theme from Star Wars, the Death Star. That's how I look at marriage. Sorry, ladies. I'm just joking. But "engage" means to bring things together. When we use mind maps, we use them to take all these thoughts we have in our heads which can be very confusing, and we want to organize them and make it a nice way to follow like a highway, right? A road you drive through. We're going to organize so you know exactly where to drive and it's nice and smooth.

So the mind map helps you because it takes you -- it takes what's in your head, and it shows you, "This is what I know. This is what I understand. And I'm going to put it on a paper so I can put it out there and know what's inside my head." And once it's outside of my head, I can start moving it. Because sometimes, when information is in your head, it's confusing. It just moves all around. And we want to make it nice and straight and easy to look at. A mind map helps with that, with organization.

In a second I'm going to explain -- because this is a simple mind map -- but I'm actually using a mind map to explain my maps. Woo! Woo! Okay. So we want to -- it helps us think through, but it also helps us engage. Because it's my information, I'm putting it down, I'm engaged, which means I'm part of the process, like "engagement", "part of". And I'm working through it, okay? So you take it out of your head, put it down, and you're engaged. This also helps with memory. And you're going to see me keep mentioning memory again and again. Because part of what I promised is you will learn the language -- the new vocabulary when you use this -- you can learn language and remember it permanently. Well, this is the first part of helping with that memory -- getting it out of your head, on paper, helps you with repetition. Looking at what you know because if you know it, it's in your memory already.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Death is a part of life, but do you have the vocabulary you need to talk about it? In this lesson, I teach you everything you need to know to talk about death and dying, so that you can express yourself fully when you have to. You'll also learn some culturally accepted phrases which are used in many English speaking countries. Whether you are going to a funeral, or speaking to a friend who has lost someone, dealing with death can be unpleasant. Let's make sure that your English isn't the worst part of it! http://www.engvid.com/how-to-talk-about-death-in-english/

TRANSCRIPT

[Sings] That's like the funeral march from Star Wars. If you know Darth Vader, "Luke, I am your father." And I am James, from EngVid. And I'm going to talk about, well, not a happy subject, but a subject we should talk about nonetheless. "Nonetheless" means "anyway", right? So what are we talking about? Death. In this case, it's Mr. D has died. Long live Mr. E. You may not have met Mr. D. He's from an unsuccessful website that was started and died. That's why he's gone. The king is dead. Long live the king. Mr. E is here. Right, E? Props.

Okay. So let's talk about death. And I may be smiling too much and laughing too much, but you know what? Around the world, there are different ways to talk about or deal with death. And we're going to talk about a couple of different ways. But I'm going to give you the basic Western way of looking at death, okay?

Now, number one, this person is dead -- well, this worm is dead. One of the things we say when someone dies -- we say this: pass away. If someone has "passed away", they've died. We don't always want to go, "Did he die? Is he dead yet?" You know? It kind of seems as little bit like, "Back up. Slow down." So we say they "pass away" like a gentle breeze. They fly away. Their soul goes, right? So if you say, "Johnny, Mr. D passed away last week", it means he died. So listen for Canadians when they say that, or Americans or British people. Did they "pass away". Or they might also say it this way. They might say "gone". "When did they go? Are they gone?" You're like, "No. Still dead." Sorry. That's bad. Okay. Enough "levity", which is fun or making light of something, okay?

So let's talk about death. So if someone's gone or passed away, one of the things we like to say is "R.I.P.", R.I.P. Some people rip one, but that's not what I'm talking about. "R.I.P." as in "rest in peace". You usually say that when you give your condolences. "Condolences." All these words. "Condolences." What is a "condolence"? A "condolence" is when you say, "I'm sorry about your loss." Usually for death. "I'm sorry your father has died. I'm sorry your mother has died. I'm sorry." It's a big sorry, condolence. "Do you have any condolences? Or I'd like to give my condolences. "All right?

So they've died. They're resting in peace. Hopefully, they were good, right? Rest in peace, because they look so happy. Right? And you give your condolences. Guess what? You're not done. Unlike a wedding -- because funerals are like reverse weddings except the person gets to live through it. You've got to go to the funeral, right? Usually, before the funeral -- or part of the funeral -- is the viewing. Notice we have these people watching a picture? Well, this is when you go and see the person in their casket. See? Mr. D is in a casket. That's the thing we put them in after they die. They die; we put them in a casket. And then, you can go to a viewing. The "viewing" is you walk by -- yes. Believe it. There's a dead body -- okay. Look. Picture this. There's a dead body in the room. There are people dressed in shirts and ties like this. They walk by, and they look at the dead person. And they say things like, "I'm sorry you're dead. It was nice knowing you. Rest in peace. See you later, Chuckles." Or, "You're next." Right? So you view. You take a look at the dead body, okay?

Another word to say besides that is -- because some people say -- oops. Sorry. I want to say "coffin". C-o-f-f-i-n, "coffin". A "coffin". So a "casket", "coffin". Another way of saying what this is, okay? They say, "Look at the coffin", or you buy the casket -- you buy the casket. When you put the body in it, it become a "coffin". That's the difference. You say, "How much is the casket?" Coffin. Rest in peace, dude. Okay.

So not everybody goes through this process. And we'll get to that after. But you go for the viewing. You look at the person in their coffin. All right? Now, what are you going to do with this thing? Well, you're going to have to put it in the ground. And that's what we call the "burial". We bury it. We put it. You go there. They pick up the earth. They put the coffin in the ground, and they bury it. Okay? That's what we basically call the "basic funeral". Notice these people don't look happy because there's no fun in a funeral, Son. Yeah. Okay. Moving on. Bad joke, bad joke. Okay.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Is your opinion "never" taken seriously? Do people "always" question what you say? This lesson is for you! I will teach you how to eliminate the five words that stop you from being an effective speaker. Learn what to say instead, so that you can be just as confident as a native English speaker. Take a quiz on this lesson here: http://www.engvid.com/effective-speaking-be-specific/

TRANSCRIPT

Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for the worm. I'm changing a very, very famous quote by a very good speaker, and his name was John F. Kennedy. Great American president -- or a good American president. There's another one by a British man named Winston Churchill from World War II, "Never, never, never, never give up." All right? So why am I bringing these up to you? Because to become an effective speaker, you need to know what to do. But sometimes, you need to know what not to do. And in this particular lesson, I'm going to help you become a much more effective speaker in English. To not make the mistakes that many native speakers make because it's their language, and they don't think about it, I don't want you to make these mistakes to start with. So let's go to the board shall we?

Mr. E is talking to a cat, Mr. Kitty. Meow. Okay. Why is there a cat? And if you look clearly or carefully, you'll notice there's one, two, three, four, five legs. Well, when I went to school years ago, I was in a philosophy class. And one of the professors said, "When writing a good essay or writing a paper or speaking, you should beware of the five-legged cat." "Beware" means "watch out for". Now, in your own language, you might do this, and many people in English do this a lot. Notice I said "many", not "all". And that's one of the key things. They use words like "every, all, none, never, and always." I'm sure you've heard English people use them, and you're thinking, "What's wrong? There's nothing wrong with them." Well, there isn't, as long as they have a reference. So if you say, for instance, "All of the people in this room", that's okay. But if you say, "All people think", we have a problem because you're generalizing. And that's what we're talking about. How to avoid generalization, all right? Or exaggeration. There's a fancy English word for this, and it's called "hyperbole", and it means to use words in a way to evoke, which means to get a strong emotional reaction. So a lot of people use these words because they want to get something from you. They want to prove a point strongly. Or they want you to get really energetic about it. Good point, "you always leave the toilet up." "Always? Always? Every single time in my whole life you've seen the toilet up? Always?" Clearly, it's not true. But when you say "always", you don't have to look at specific, you can just generalize. Generalization can be helpful. But when you really want people to understand, it actually takes away from what you're trying to do. So let's go to the board and take a look at it.

How can we get around this generalization problem that happens many times when people speak? Well, there are better words to use. Now, if you don't know what these words are, that's part of the problem. Okay. So let's take a look at the first two words, one and two, "always" and "never".

What people don't realize because where I'm from, most of us aren't taught grammar; we learn it. And we use it. And we're pretty good at using it, but we don't actually understand exactly where they come from. So if you've got English friends, this is a good lesson for you to turn on for them, too.

"Always" and "never". There's a term for this. "Always" and "never" belong to what I call, "The Seven Sisters." These are called "adverbs of frequency", okay? Adverbs of frequency tell us how often something happens or how much you repeat something in a period of time. I can actually put another word for this one, "often", here, see? "Often". Okay. So adverbs of frequency tell you once a week, five times a day, six times a year. That's how many times I repeat something in a period of time.

"Always" and "never", if you notice, are part of the adverbs of frequency. There's nothing wrong with them except they give you nothing -- they say these are absolutes, always, forever, now, and in the future. And this isn't how the world works. If it was, we'd all be perfect. And I don't know about you, but I'm not very perfect. Okay.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Watch this lesson to learn some easy English idioms that are related to animals. These common phrases can help you sound like a native speaker, and to understand English shows and movies. If you're done pigging out, and are tired of all the monkey business, join me and Mr. E! You will learn idiomatic expressions, and I promise, no one will rat on you!

TRANSCRIPT

Okay. Hi. James, from EngVid. I've just been shocked. And it's bringing out my animal nature. Today's video is on expressions -- some people say "idioms" -- but expressions using animals. Now, in English, you will find there are a lot of expressions and animals, and people never really think about it. In fact, I think in your own language, the same thing happens. You have expressions with animals, and you use them every day. What I want to do today is give you about six of them from different animals, and I want you to get the understanding because this will help you when we do other ones later or for ones you already know.

Animals are usually used to show human behavior. Huh? Well, yeah. When we say, like, "crazy like a fox", we mean really smart and intelligent, stealthlike. Not stealthlike, but you know, clever. "Clever" means to have good skill. So we're talking about human characteristics or things that human have. And we're showing animals that depict -- and "depict" is another way for saying "show" -- show how or in the best way to illustrate to other people. I must be a visual person because I like these visual words. Okay. But they show that in the best way for people to look at the animal and understand instantly. And that's one of the best reasons for using these kinds of idioms because what you really mean, people understand, even if you don't use it perfectly. I mean, like, "Smells like a rat". I said that today, and I meant "smell a rat", and that's one of them you're going to learn today. Because as soon as you know, you know, "Oh, that must be bad." Even though I didn't say it correctly, we'll get it better than some other idioms you might try to use to express yourself. So if you keep in mind that animals are used to show human behavior, then, you'll basically understand why we use animal idioms, and it will be easier for you to remember. Okay? You like that? Yeah. Because you're crazy like a fox. Okay.

Where should we start? What the? Whoa. Okay. Apology time. Sorry. The EngVid art department is not here. Usually these would be drawn much better, but our monkey looks like something on LSD. Okay? The rat looks like it has rabies, which is a disease. And the pig looks like it's been going on, like -- I don't know. I don't want to say somebody's diet because somebody will get angry because it means the pig looks fat. Like it's been on the -- okay, whatever. Whoever's diet, okay? But let's get to the board and talk about the animal expressions, okay? I did two for each. And when you think about them, remember what I said. Animals show human characteristics or actions or behavior, okay? And this will help you remember.

Well, I like this one, "Monkey see, monkey do." No. 1. What does that mean? It means to copy. If you watch monkeys or apes [makes monkey sounds], you know, Tarzan's ape, they copy humans all the time, and we love them, right? You see them walking and talking and trying to act like us. And because of that, we use the idiom, "Monkey see, monkey do", to talk about a person who is copying you or copying someone else, especially babies and children. If you take up a cigarette and smoke, if you look down, a baby will pick up a pen or a pencil and pretend to smoke. And the mother might say, "Monkey see, monkey do." Okay? In a way, it's an insult. Remember this. Because monkeys are considered lesser humans -- well, less than humans. So if someone says "monkey see, monkey do", they're not really giving you a compliment.</media:description>

Что на самом деле значит слово "SURE" в английском

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James, from EngVid. How are you doing? Are you sure you're good? You don't sound good. Well, let's take a look at the word "sure". What does "sure" mean?

When we look at the word "sure" in English, it basically means "assured". It's a small word for "I believe", right? So are you sure about something? You believe something. But I wanted to give you a different lesson, not the dictionary lesson. I want to give you a lesson based on -- it's not the slang use, but the colloquial use, which means the common people use for the word "sure". And there are basically four different types of "sure". They sound similar, but you can count on me, I'm sure they're different. All right? So let's go to the board.

Mr. E is at a fair or a carnival. And in the West, when we go to a carnival, it's -- you know, like a fair. There are clowns and games you can play. This is called a "strongman" game. When you hit it, a little thing moves up, and it tells you how strong you are, right? So you can go from zero percent all the way to 100. And 100 would make you like a Superman or superhero, right? And zero, well, it means you're kind of weak -- not very good.

So what we're doing here is we're going to show you how sure your sures are. I'm sure that's right. All right? Let's go to the board.

Now, let's start with the basic one. No. 1 sure. I know you're going, " 'Sure' means you're certain" But when we generally use it, we say "sure" as in, "Yeah. No problem". So I might say to you, "Do you want a coffee?" And you go, "Sure". You don't have to say "yes"; you can say "sure". Yes. It has the idea of "I'm certain", but it means more like this, "Yes. Yes I want one". All right?

What's the next one? It's this crazy one where it's like I have a problem because I can't speak properly because you say, "Sure, sure". And you go, "Why 'sure, sure'?". "Sure" means "yes". This is a little bit different than the yes -- simple yes. It means maybe I'm busy writing, and you ask me some questions, and I go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure". It basically means, "Yeah, go ahead". And not just "yes", but "go and do everything. Complete it. Don't bother me anymore. I'm busy. I've already said yes. And I'm saying yes. Now, you have the go ahead -- two words -- to complete it. You don't have to ask me anymore. Sure, sure. That's it. We're done. Finish it. Don't come back and keep asking me questions on it". All right? So you might get "Sure. That's a good idea". Like, "Sure, sure. Finish it". Okay? That's two.

Now, what about No. 3? "I'm sure". You should learn "I'm sure" for a reason. "I'm sure" means, well, No. 1, "I'm 100 percent certain on something". So you go, "Is this the correct way to Toronto?" You go, "I'm sure. I'm sure it is". It means "I believe 100 percent it's correct". There's another reason for using "sure", and it works like this. When somebody doesn't believe you're correct on something, and they say, "Are you sure about that?" You say, "I'm sure". "Sure" isn't enough because you're just saying "yes". Remember? I know in the dictionary it means "to know" or "to have knowledge or belief". But you need to actually make it stronger and refer with, "I'm sure this is correct", which means there is no doubt, or there is no question in my mind about what I'm saying. All right? So we've taken this word, and we've made it stronger -- given permission. Right? We've made it very strong.

But what about this one? If you watch enough television -- and I'm sure you do. I said "sure" again. I believe, right? I'm sure you do. I really believe you do. You'll hear this one, "Sure. She's the prettiest pig in all of Canada". Right? And what does that mean? Well, this is the word "sarcastic". When somebody is being sarcastic, it means they're not really -- they don't really believe what they're saying, or they're making fun of something. By saying something positive, they're actually making fun of it. So in this case, they're saying, "Sure". And it means the opposite of, "I'm sure" "I don't believe" Right? "Sure, you work for the queen of England. I don't believe you". "Well, I'm sure you do. You have the credentials". It means, "I do believe you". Okay. Anyway.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ When you have the right textbook, you will find that learning English doesn't have to be hard or boring. If you are studying English on your own, I'll show you how to choose the right textbook -- what to look for, and what to avoid. These are the two English textbooks I mention at the end of the video: http://www.engvid.com/out/amz_basicgrammar http://www.engvid.com/out/amz_azar Take a quiz on this lesson here: http://www.engvid.com/how-to-choose-a-textbook/

I need a book on how to be a gentleman. I need to know my -- hi. James, from EngVid. This book is called "How to Be a Gentleman", by John Bridges. It's sort of like a textbook. And what is a textbook? A textbook is a book designed to teach you something with exercises that will bring you from one place to another. So when you're finished doing the textbook, you should learn a skill. Unlike a book that you read for enjoyment, which is fun -- you enjoy; you put away -- a textbook is usually used in schools to teach skills. And through exercises and tests, you master it. This is sort of like a textbook, but it's a little bit fun.

My job today is to do something we haven't done before. You come to EngVid to learn English, which is true, and this is great. But you could also buy books outside. I'm sure some of you have bought books outside. When I teach, some of my students, before they go back to their countries, they say, "Teacher, I need a book to help me with my grammar or my English." One of my colleagues at EngVid has done a lesson. You should check it out. It's about books you should read. But this one is specific. This is on textbooks, the books that teachers may use in schools or you can buy by yourself, which will help you increase on your IELTS, on your TOEFL, or on your grammar or vocabulary. And these are books designed for people who are learning English as a second language, okay? And that's what this lesson is today. "How to pick a good textbook." So see, gentlemen? How to pick a good textbook, a textbook that would help you.

I can give you ten books that I think are good textbooks. But I am not you, and I'm not your teacher -- well, I am. I know. I'm sorry. I like you, too. Okay, we love each other. But I mean, I'm not there to help you. If I were sitting with you, talking to you, I'd say, "You know what? This book isn't good for you. This book is good for you." And because I wanna help you -- see, I said "wanna". See that's a grammar thing. Because I want to help you, I'm going to give you something that you can use to find a textbook for yourself. There are probably many books in your country, and you don't know which is a good one. I don't want you to waste your money, and I want you to learn. Okay? So let's go to "How to Pick a Good Textbook".

I found there were approximately ten points that you should have when you're going to buy a textbook. They can be very expensive and very helpful, okay? If you pick the wrong one, though, it's not a good use of your money, and it will take time -- valuable time from your learning.

The first thing you should look at is when was the book made? If the book is old -- it is 20 years old; it's not a good book because they probably don't talk about computers or laptops or email and addressing any of that. And you're going to be looking at books where you're saying, "Well, golly gee, sir, I think the rain on the plain in Spain is mainly..." -- it's out-of-date. We call something "out-of-date". If the book is over ten years old -- probably not good to use, right? Probably want to say away. Get a more up-to-date book, one with more modern examples that will talk about technologies you're using today. Okay?

The next one is what do you need? I don't know how many students come to me and say they want to listen -- get better hearing skills. And then they tell me how they're watching the news. And they're level two or three. And I'm like, "Stop immediately!" You shouldn't be watching the news until you have 80 percent of the language. It's just too much for you. What do you need it for? "Well, Teacher, I want to watch my TV program." Well, watch your TV program. "What do you need" is what you work on. If you need IELTS or TOEFL, don't use a basic grammar book. You should be high enough that you can use the books that you're testing for. What do you need? Do you need it for work? Then you need technical books, books that work specifically with technical language or formal language. Are you going on vacation? Then, you need a book with pictures and drawings and fun stuff. Heck, heck, you can even watch TV programs for children. What do you need? So in a textbook, look at what do you need, and the textbook addresses -- when we say "address", it's working towards what you need, not what you think your friend has or someone would tell you.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Do you always know which words are verbs, nouns, adjectives, or adverbs? If not, this grammar lesson on suffixes, or word endings, will help you. I'll also teach you the 3 most useful word endings that will make learning English much easier. Take a quiz on this lesson here: http://www.engvid.com/english-grammar-suffixes/

Teacher favorites. What should we do now? Hi. James, from EngVid. Looking for classroom stuff because you know we have so much here for you. But before I forget, I can't do my job without my favorite pal in the world, Mr. E. And this lesson today, actually, guys, it's sort of a lesson that we did before, and it's a second part. I didn't say it was a second part, but it is. You'll go back -- if you go to EngVid, you can see the lesson on prefixes, which funny enough, is the beginning of the word, and this is the end of the word, which are called "suffixes".

Let's start from the beginning. What are suffixes? Let's go to the board. A suffix: "suf" means -- this part of the word here actually means "under". It means "under" or "lower". Why? When we did prefixes, prefixes meant "before", which meant you put two, three, or five letters in front of a word. And that actually changed the meaning of the word if you remember. If we did "do" and "redo", they're not the same meaning. "Do" -- one time, "redo" means "start again". 

When we do suffixes, a suffix goes on the end of the word. And I'm going to try to explain to you by going here first. Grammar suffixes. You've seen these before. S, ED, and ING. When we have S -- you know if you see a pronoun ending in S, like -- sorry. A verb, I should say. "She is", "he goes" -- you know by seeing the S on the end of that verb that that verb is taking on a third person singular. In other words, it's talking about a person we don't know, right? And it's a singular person. So that's the grammar suffix, one letter added on. When you see ED on the end of the word, you know that that means this verb is in the past. "I watch TV all the time." "I watched television last night." "I stopped my car in front of the house." This is something that happened in the past, not now. When we have the third ending you're familiar with, ING, they're used for gerunds. And you know the gerund has three uses: It's either a present participle -- working, talking, singing; an adjective -- a climbing tree or a swimming pool; or just a noun -- cooking. Yeah, I know. All end in ING, but they have three different functions. 

Well, these are examples of suffixes -- letters at the end of the word that change the class or the verb function, you might say, or the grammar function. But it doesn't actually change the meaning of the word. "Swim", "swimming" -- similar. Okay? 
Now, how do I explain this? Well, when we do this, we do the same thing here, which is grammar, specifically, but now, we can change the word class. What I mean is going from -- this is just changing a verb. We're actually going to change the class from, maybe, a noun to an adjective or an adverb, okay? With me so far? It's easy. We're going to add a few letters at the end of the word, and it will change what type of word it is. Is it a noun? Is it a verb? Is it an adverb? Is it an adjective? That's it. And by doing these -- adding some of these, that's how we do it in English. Excuse me. So let's take a look. 

These are the top three that you'll find in English. On the last video, at the end of the video, I told you, like, we don't use these for 95 percent, so I'll fix this now. These are the most common, and what I mean by "common" is "most useful for you." There are many other suffixes. But these are most useful for you to kind of figure out or understand words that you'll see because this will tell you what's, basically, the meaning. So I'm going to help you with what the meaning is and how it changes it. So you can look at words and kind of go, "Okay, this must be a noun because I see this ending. Or this must be an adjective." Sound cool? Let's go to the board.

Mr. E, help me with the class. It's a joke. See, you're the class now and "word class". Anyway. The first one we're going to look at is MENT, m-e-n-t. "Government", "improvement", all right? When we add MENT to the end of a word, it's used to make nouns. So what you'll see is this added to a word becomes a noun. And what does it mean? Well, it means an action or process. Okay? So we talk about government, you think, "Okay, now, it's the people, like the president -- President Obama, President Reagan, Prime Minister Harper." Yeah, I like him. Anyway. Sorry. It's a process. So we talk about government is helping the people. That's what they do when they govern. When we put MENT in, we talk about the institution or the group of people that help the People. Cool? So "governing" the verb means to help the People; "government" is the group of people or institution of people that help the People. That's one example.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

"Robin, come in." "Robin here." Hi. James, from EngVid. Sorry. Reading "Batman: Black and White". I almost wanted to say "Blackman: Black and White", but I didn't. Hi. So what am I doing today besides joking with you? Look, I want to teach a lesson today -- and already, the naysayers -- the "naysayers" are the people who say "no" before you finish. So you teachers out there that watch these lessons, I know you'll go, "Oh, well this rule isn't right because --." This isn't about that. I'm telling you now there are lessons on the video -- and actually on EngVid -- that go into greater detail and explain very well what I'm about to teach. This lesson is very specific. It's a quick way and a short way for you to remember some grammar problems which are very common among many students. 
If you teach English, you know exactly what I mean. If you're a student, you know what I mean. And if you're somebody who is studying English on your own, when people look at you strangely, and then they explain to you, you know what I mean.
So this is JamesESL's 80 percent rules. Three quick rules for grammar. And the 80 percent -- who could possibility forget the best guy in the world? Because he's going to be our percent sign today. Mr. E! Okay. Mr. E is the percent sign. So it's our 80 percent rules. 
What do I mean by that? There are many exceptions to everything I'm going to tell you. I'm saying this up front so you don't get confused later on. But you will be correct 80 percent of the time without thinking if you master these rules. And the exceptions -- go to the other lessons on the site, and there's a lesson for each one of these. I'm telling you. I did this because it's easier for you to read, write, and do well when you know these rules, okay?
So let's start with No. 1. Very often, students say, "I say him." And I go, "What?" "I say him, 'I go home, now.'" I go, "What?" "I say him." You can't "say" him. Remember: "Say" by itself means "single". S equals "single", right? "Single" means "one". "I say all the time." "He said to me." Right? Say and said, past form of "say". It's for "one". One person is speaking. So when you just say "say" by itself, think "single". And you'll notice I've got S and S. But then you say, "James, I want to say -- I want to say two people or more. I say him all the time." Okay. Okay. I'll help you. This is the James 80 percent rule. Say "to" him. "What?" Say "to" him. "To" indicates a subject and an object -- a person is speaking to another person. "What did you say to him?" "Oh!" See? Right? You add the magic "to", and now, you can talk to more than one person and address it. "What did he say to him?" Got it? But if you say something, "I say", "he says", "they said" -- single "say". If you want to add an object or a person you're referring to, then we say "say to". And the "to" gives you the idea of two or more. You like that? I got more. 
Okay. I don't even like saying "to". It's so five-letterish. Why don't we just stick with four letters? "Tell". Think T in "tell" means "two". You know how you say "say to", two words? You can combine that and just say "tell". "I told" -- tell and told. So we'll put "told" here because it's the same thing, really. Past tense, just like "said" is here, right? "I told him." Right? Subject and object. "What did he tell you?" Subject and object. T stands for "two". So whenever you see "say" or "tell", if you have "say" and "to" -- "to" means "two", right? You like that? And "tell" -- T means "two". You keep getting this T thing, and you know it's "two" -- an object and a subject is speaking to an object. Quick and easy. Dirty, clean -- I don't care. It's yours. All right? You like that? I got more. See this sleeve? Are you looking up the sleeve? Boom. 
Back to the board. Okay. No. 2: third person singular. "Hablar -- hablar en español." You know, when you say "you", you use S. "Hablas", "tienes" -- that's all the Spanish I know. You watched my other video where I say "bro"? See? I told you to look for ten. Here's one video where you've got "bro", okay? Try and find nine more. Anyway. So you think third person, like "work". Well, "it" means "one". "He" means "one". "She" means "one". S stands for "single". We're going to go back up here again. S stands for "single". I told you, it's James' 80 percent rule. One word rules them all. Or as my friends who like The Hobbit say, "And one ring shall control them all ...</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Do you know when you can call a group of girls "guys", or when your "girlfriend" is just a friend and not your lover? Do English speakers give you confused looks when you talk about your partner? Well, watch this English vocabulary lesson, and be confused no more. Understand what REAL English speakers mean when they say someone is their partner, brother, girlfriend, and more. Test your understanding of these words with the quiz at: http://www.engvid.com/confusing-gender-words-in-english/

TRANSCRIPT:
No entiendo nada. Hey. James, from EngVid, speaking Spanish. Si? I'm looking at a French book, but you guys understand. It's good for a teacher to learn different languages because as they get better, they understand how to teach you, right? Right, guys? Come to think of it, there's a word I was thinking about. I've been asked by many a student, "When we say, 'guys', can we use it for everybody or is it just for men or" -- because they get confused because in North America, we use the word "guys". And when we do, we use it for groups of people that could be male and female. Now, in our language, you don't have, really, gender. There's no "el" as in -- excuse me for a second. You know, in Spanish, you've got the "el", or the "le" in French and the "la" -- we don't have any of that. No. Not at all. So most people assume there's no gender, but I have a secret. In English, we do have gender. Come on. We're going to go to the board. We're going to work it out, all right? 

So what do I mean by "gender words"? Well, there will be no cue like this. And this is what makes it confused, and that's why this is "confused words in English". Because they're confused gender words -- words that can be used by only one sex, and only one sex uses them in this way. And if you say it a different way, you will confuse us. Okay? So why don't we start off with, well, No. 1. See? Confused. Two is over here; one is over here. The lesson has begun. Mr. E secretly is watching me teach this lesson. This is the female symbol and the male symbol because these are gender words. "Gender" means "sex", and we mean "boy", "girl", "men", "women". Your "gender" is your "sex". When you fill out forms in English, it will say "male", "female" -- that's gender. Okay? Are you male, man, female, woman? So now we're there, why don't we go and take a look. 

"Guys", I started with "guys". You'll notice that "guys" has -- well, we got two guys and a girl. We can also have mini guys, Mini Mes. Okay? A group of men can be called "guys". A group with even one woman can still be called "guys". And a group with all women could be called "guys". But you cannot call a group of men "girls". If you go, "Hey girls! Hey girls!" They're all gay. I'm sorry if anyone says, you know, "Whoa!" But it's -- "girls" would be gay, you know. Or we use it as an insult to guys, "Look at the girls over there." Because we're saying, "They're not He-Men like us. So they're a bunch of girls!" Right? "Quit crying, you girls!" So when we use "girls" as a reference to guys, it's an insult either in, "You're not a man" or we're saying they may be of a different sexual orientation. You like those big words? I do, too. Okay. So that's one thing to think about. 

So you're going to think, "Okay, so I can use 'guys' all the time." Well, you're right. But there is one difference. You don't use "guys" with older, mature women because it's almost insulting because they're going to say, "We're ladies. We're women, not guys. We're not little girls." Right? Even older businessmen like being referred to as "guys" because it's that sports, macho, manly thing. Right? "Look at the guys." "Let's go, guys." But if it's an older woman or a group of older women, please say, "ladies". All right? Or "women" -- do not call them "guys" unless they have moustaches, and they're really old. Anyway. That's different. 

So "guys" you understand that one. That's one of the confusing words. So simply, to make it simple so you understand exactly what I want, "guys" can be used for any group with a female in or a completely -- a complete group of females, okay, and males. For males, it can be used for young males to older males, no problem. Our exception is with older females; you must actually call them "ladies" or "women".</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Learn important, basic words you will need when you travel. Knowing a little English vocabulary can help a lot when you are travelling. Whever you are going in the world, you can almost always find someone who speaks some English. I'll teach you how a "tourist attraction" is different from a "tourist trap". What about "sight seeing"? Do you know what an "itinerary" is? Do you have your travel documents? Get ready for your English to take flight! http://www.engvid.com/travel-vocabulary/

Hi. James, from EngVid. I was just about to plan my vacation. I'm going to take a long flight to Europe. I'm trying to remember luggage and baggage things, you know? It's kind of hard to do. But this is a lesson for you if you've been working a lot, you need some time off. Now, there's a video I would like you to go check out. That's on time off. It goes with this one. You might want to go away somewhere and not just stay home, right? So this video is for you. This is basic vocabulary on vacation. When you leave and maybe you go to an English speaking country and you want to practice your English, this stuff will be good for you to enjoy your time there, also to make it easy for you when you arrive. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

Mr. E, Mr. E! It's a mystery where he is. It's no mystery. And you thought I forgot. Mr. E has been on vacation with me, and he's enjoying this particular attraction. So let's go to the board.

Now, if you're going to go on vacation, one of the first things you will have to do if you're leaving your country is you're going to need some travel documents. What are those? Documents. A "document" is a paper or something with information that tells you something is okay or outlines it for you. For example, your passport is a document given by the government with your picture on it that says you are a citizen of this country, and you are legal. You are a good person. Okay? Now, when you're leaving for a flight, or you want to go to another country, you're going to need travel documents first. Trust me; show up at the airport and go, "I leave now. I go to Canada." They will go, "And the car is that way. Go home, crazy man. Okay?" So we need travel documents. So what are "travel documents"? Well, "travel documents" would be your passport, government identification, usually needed at most places the travel. Inside of a country, not necessary for most places. But leaving the country, you have to have it. Okay? So if you're in the European Union, no problem. If you're in Canada and the United States, you don't need one. But as soon as you leave these countries, you need a passport.

What's another thing you need? Well, you need what's called a "boarding pass". If you play soccer, you kick the ball; the other guy, he catches it; you "pass" right? The ball goes from one player to another. A "boarding pass" is what allows you to go from one country to another country. You show the person on the airplane this piece of paper with your passport, and they say, "You know what? You can come on the plane and fly, like the pass." Kick, catch, other country. Cool? All right. So these are your travel documents. You need those.

Now, I should have started with you need to make a plan because you want to go visit some place. You want to go on vacation, right? And if you want to go on vacation, well, going to have to -- I said "vacation". A "vacation" is a holiday, another word for saying "time off from work". All right? So you want to go on vacation. Sometimes, we say, "We're going to vacation in Italy." Or "on my vacation, I want to visit Italy." Or "I'm taking a holiday in Italy." Okay? So all these words, when people say, "Well, what are you doing on your time off?" You might go, "I'm going on vacation." Then they know you're leaving. If you just say, "I'm taking time off from work", you could be home cleaning. But no. You're saying, "I'm going on vacation." They're going to go, "Where are you going to visit? Italy, perhaps? Sicily? Is it going to be a good holiday?" And you go, "Yes. I earned my time." "Earned" means to work for something. "I earned my time off. I'm going on vacation."</media:description>

<media:description>There are easy ways to learn English, and here are 3 methods NOT taught in language schools or textbooks. These methods are fun, fast, and easy to learn! You will learn how to make studying English easier, and learn how to spend less time studying. Take this lesson and learn the secrets to getting better in English right now.

"The Prosperity Plan." It's empty. Why? Well, hi. James, from EngVid. I have a book, and it says "Prosperity Plan". I know you're here to learn English. This is a book full of secrets on how to make millions of dollars. Empty. That's because when people tell you there's a secret, there's not really a secret; there's a method behind something, and you may not know it, so to you it's a secret, but you know, just like that book, there are no secrets. The only one is hard work. Let's look at the three methods I have for you today in order to learn English, okay? Call them the "Secrets you need to know" because most people don't know them because the funny thing is, although they're not secret -- I said it again -- they're not methods that are usually taught in ESL books. 
The Kaizen Method, the Process Method, and the Writing Method are actually books I read on something completely different. But what I found was they were very, very handy for learning English. Personally, I'm trying to learn Spanish, and when I apply these different methods, I found my learning going faster and faster, and I actually enjoyed it. So I called them "secret" for you because I'm quite sure that your teachers haven't sat down and gone, "Today, we're going to learn the Kaizen Method of English. Then, we'll do the Process Method, and then we'll do the Writing Method." No. Because they're actually three different books, all right? So I'm just going to give you a part of each book, and if I come across to the end, I'll give you another lesson on it, all right? But these are three things I liked out of these books.
All right. Let's start from the first one, the Process Method. I know -- and it's in red, and I start here why? Most of the times people are learning a language, they want to -- and this is what the Process Method is about. People start with "product", "product". What is a "product"? A "product" is something you can touch or hold. This marker is a product. But this isn't how the marker started. I'm sorry. Okay, the marker started a little differently. I mean, that's an alcohol base that I'm sniffing. When I go [inhales], there's liquid in here. This is plastic -- came from oil. So why I'm telling you all these things -- you're going, "Why are you telling me?" Well, things start in a certain way, but they end up like this. In fact, you can think of the Process Method versus product as being a tree and being a seed. And a seed, you know, little thing, you put it in the ground, and it grows into a tree. Well, when you have a seed, the seed has no idea that it's going to be a tree and a big tree -- how long it will take. But humans are funny. They want to start a language, and they think right away, "I'm going to learn English." And then, they sit down; they open the book; they open the book; "I'm going to learn English. I'm learning English. I'm learning English." And then they get upset one hour later. "I don't know any English. I don't speak English." Well, it's like being a human. You start as a baby, you grow to an adult. When we talk about the Process Method, what you want to do is don't think about you want to speak English. Yes, I know. That's why you're watching this video and why you're studying. Think more about what you're doing while you're studying English. And this is called the "process". Go into the step. Concentrate on what you're doing. You'll find a couple of things happen: Sometimes you'll say English is hard or it's boring. If you do this method, you'll actually stop finding it hard or boring, and you'll enjoy it because you'll be working on something specific, mastering that, and then you're going to start noticing that the final product -- English -- is coming to you. And it will come faster than you think. Why? Well, if you're thinking, "I don't understand this English", you're focusing, really, on you don't understand English or you don't know English. You're not focusing on what you're doing. If you take a breath [inhales] and go [exhales], "Okay. I'm just watching this video of this crazy guy who speaks very quickly in English, and just now, he told me to take a breath. Oh, okay. I understand." And you're ahead. That's the Process Method. Take time to actually go back -- when you're thinking about it's hard; it's difficult or boring -- and say to yourself, "What am I doing now?" And then look at that. Each time you do that, you get further in the process and you will end up with a product before you know it. Okay? Sounds simple, but try it. You can even do this on a date. That's another story.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT:
The Canadian-English Dictionary. Over 500 sold. Not many Canadians, I think, eh? Just joking. It's 500,000, and my name is James from EngVid. Welcome. I'm going to help you today learn to use this thing and not this thing. And there's a reason why, and I'm going to tell you why today because I think it's an important lesson that I don't see people really talk about a lot. They -- in classes, and I teach classes, we mention it. And students always come -- not always. Bad. You're so forward. They usually use an electronic dictionary, but I prefer the paper because today I'm going to teach you how to build your vocabulary using this, something that's a few hundred years old.

So let's start off: "Know your dictionary." Do you know what your dictionary -- do you know who your dictionary is or what your dictionary is? I ask you because I'm going to ask you do you know "prescriptive" versus "descriptive"? Most students don't know the difference, and it's a very important difference for you to know. If you're a native English speaker, this is your dictionary. It's good. It's great. It says things like, "'Choral' -- or of a choir. 'Chorale': slow stately hymn tune", and you're thinking, well, if you're learning English, "What did James just say to me?" There are many of these things. "'Retrench': reduce expenditure, cut." You know, like, "What?" Well, this is because it's prescriptive. "Prescriptive". Think of a doctor, you know, the guy who checks your chest, like, your heart. He prescribed something to you, right? Gives you something. But he doesn't give you any kind of extra information. He's the doctor. He's the expert. They tell you and you know. Well, if you have a command of the English language or you speak English, of course you know all the other words they use. "'Critic': Professional judge." I know all these words. I don't have to learn these words, so it's great. But if you're learning English -- and learning English -- and I want to tell you this because a lot of people don't know. You know my name, right? My name is James ESL, right? James. I can't even spell my own name. It's a lie. My name is James ESL. And some of you said, for sure, "What is "ESL? That's a funny name." Because it's not my name. "ESL" stands for "English as a Second Language". That's what it stands for. Many of your teachers use it, and they never tell you what it means. So it means James is teaching English as a second language. And that's for you guys. You have French, Hindi, Arabic as first languages, and you want to get another language. What you need is a descriptive dictionary. What does that mean? Well, let me explain something to you. There is a thing that is long, has a big head, a smile. It has little lines on its body. Its first name starts with M. His last name starts with E. Do you know whom I'm describing? It's Mr. E. Right? I described it to you. An ESL dictionary is descriptive, right? So the first thing you should know is, is your dictionary prescriptive or descriptive? "Prescriptive", like a prescription from a doctor -- it just tells you this is what the word means. It does not give explanation -- it gives an explanation, but no diagrams and no definition, okay? Or explanation. For example, a descriptive one not only tells you what the world is, it gives you an example of its use in speech. It helps you. Maybe even a picture to show you. That's for the ESL. So when you're looking for a paper dictionary, go to your bookstore and ask for a descriptive dictionary because you're studying ESL, and they'll give you the perfect dictionary for you, okay?

So what are we going to do next? That's the first thing:  Know what dictionary you have because this one will help. Now, I will tell you this, though: Once you start going from the beginning and intermediate, you need the prescriptive because that's what a fluent native speaker would use, and that's what you use. So there's a reason for both. Don't forget that. If you're advanced, get prescriptive. If you're new, get descriptive. Know your dictionary.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT 
                                  
Hi. James, from EngVid. Today's video is on, well, "The Book of Bad English". There are mistakes that native speakers make that ESL people pick up -- and "ESL" is "English as a Second Language". People learning English, they pick up because native speakers don't even know they're making this mistake. So I want to teach you six common ones that come regularly or happen regularly in conversation. And I want you to learn them and make your English perfect. Let's go to the board. 
Now, let's start with No. 1, one of my favorite ones: "amount" and "number". "Amount" is, sort of, like, "how much". A "number" is, you know, "thing". When we look at "amount", you can think of you can't count it, all right?  A lot of times, when we say "amount" -- like, "I have a large amount of water in my house" -- you can't count water. But you can count a number, so: "The number of people who come to the city is in the thousands", so you can count them. Here's an example. Tell me if this is right or wrong. "The amount of students who are late is growing every day" or "the number of students who are late is growing every day." You should say "number" because you can count students. You can't count amount. That rhymes. Maybe that'll help, right? You can't count amount. You can't count amount. So when we want to talk about a number of something or a body of something, "amount" is for things you cannot count, and "number" is for things you can count. English people make this mistake a lot. 
Next: "among" and "between". When I used to teach "among" and "between", I would say, "'Among' is 'with'. So there're five chairs, and you're 'with' another. And 'between' is you're in the middle." That's it. Because I was so smart. And then I found out it's just this: two. More than two. That's it. Nothing special. When you talk about "between", except -- and this is a major exception -- when you're talking about differences. Differences you have to use "between". But generally speaking, "among" is more than two. "I was sitting among my friends at the bar." You can know there're probably four or five, not two. But "let's keep this between you and me"? A lot of times, Canadians say, "Let's keep this among us." And it's like, "Among who?" "The rest of those guys, you know. The Americans. They don't need to know this." Okay. So "between us" -- usually two, right? It could be two groups. "There was a fight between this country and that country." Right? Because it's two groups. But "among" is for more than two, cool? All right. So "among" -- more than two; "between" -- two. 
What about "bring" and "take"? This is something that a lot of students make a mistake on. So you say, "Bring this to me" or "take this to him." It's very easy. "Bring" is "to the speaker", okay? And "take" is "away from the speaker". Now, if you're born in England, that's easy because they always talk about "I want takeaway." Takeaway. Because they take the food away from the restaurant, right? So one of my favorite sayings that we say in England -- not England -- that we say here is, like -- watch every space movie: "Take me to your leader." You'll never see a space movie, unless it's made by me -- and it would say, "Bring me to your leader." We don't do that. You say, "Take them to the leader" because you're taking them away from this spot where the speaker is to a new location or spot. So "take" and "bring" are easy because it's "bring -- come towards". Here's a mistake -- not Canadians -- English speakers make that you should be aware of. They'll say something like, "Don't forget to bring your bag with you" instead of, "Don't forget to take your bag." Do you know what the difference is? Well, you're leaving, right? So you need to take it away. Remember I said "away from"? Take the bag away from you. When you say, "Bring the bag with you", the speaker's speaking, you're still moving away from the speaker, right? So you've got to use this. But Canadians and Americans and Brits say it a lot. They'll say, "Bring it with you." No. "Take" it with you. You know the difference now because you're smart. And you're studying from The Book of Bad English. Good for you. There's a worm in that book. Watch it. 
Okay. "Fewer" or "less". I'm going to make a statement, and think which one is correct. "'Fewer' than a million people have watched the videos on EngVid. 'Less' than a million people have watched the videos on EngVid." Which one would be correct? Yeah. If you said "less than", no. "Less" is similar to "amount". You say "fewer" for things you can count.</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from EngVid. I've had a little to drink. Hold on. Sorry. James from EngVid. I had a little to drink with my friend Mr. E. Today we're going to do "bar talk", and why it's very important. You know what you're getting. So let me tell you a little story, okay? 

I was sober when I started this video, and then, well, Mr. E invited me out to a bar. He said, "It's on me." I'm not a rich man, but I'm a smart man, so I said, "Sure, I'll go with you." So, you know, we go to the bar, and he said, "You know what? It's cheaper to get a pitcher than it is to buy a glass of beer." And I went, "That's great." So he goes up to the bartender, and he says, "Bartender -- barkeep, he said, what's on tap? What's on tap?" "Well", the bartender said, "Well, what can I get you? Bud? Blue? Ex? Amsterdam Light? Whatever." Mr. E -- pardon me. So Mr. E said, "Sure, but I've got my own drink, and it's my own creation. It's two parts beer, one part vodka, one part you don't need to know." Okay, so it doesn't matter. He brings this back. I'm sitting at the table. I drink it. After two seconds, I'm moving around like this about to fall because this drink was really potent, terribly potent. You can see the worm goes here. I got intoxicated in about five seconds. The police had to be called. And you know what? The bartender said, "Hey, dude, you're cut off, and take the worm with you." Long story. 

Now, this is "bar talk". Because in Canada and many places across the world, we use a lot of the words I've given you, all this vocabulary, to explain or express things. And today, I'm going to let you into our secret world, so you can socialize and improve your English.

So let's go back to the beginning. What did I say? I said I was "sober". Well, if you don't have any alcohol whatsoever, which is this, okay? You don't have any of this, you're going to be "sober" -- no alcohol. I have no alcohol in my body. Now, here's the good thing: When you go to a bar, you want somebody to say to you, "It's on me". What that means is they are paying. Now, if you say these magical words, "it's on me", you're paying. Please take this from your vocabulary. Otherwise, they're always going to go, "Who's paying?" "It's on him." "Great. He's paying." Okay? So "sober" is the first word -- no alcohol. So when you're driving, you should be sober, really. "It's on me" -- somebody's paying money, right? Whoever says that, they're the one who's going to pay. 

Now, here is a "mug". It's not a word I put in for your little quiz at the end. Don't forget you have a quiz. But there's a mug or a jug of -- a mug of beer. A pitcher is bigger. It's like a big thing. So it has two, three or four glasses of beer. Because it has so much in one container, it's called a pitcher, and it's cheaper. So you can go to a bar in Canada and go, "I want a pitcher of beer", and they'll give it to you, and it will be cheaper than buying bottles. Remember the bottle I showed you? Right? It would be two, three, four of these. Save money. Drink more. 

"On tap": This is a -- well, it's because it's different. "On tap" means it's not from a bottle; it comes from, like, a "tap" -- in your house, where you wash your dishes. It comes from a keg. And a keg looks like this. I'm a really horrible drawer, so forgive me, okay? Forgive me, for I am about to sin in many ways. A keg looks like something like that, and it's on tap. So the beer comes out of that. Yeah, I know. Listen, this is an expensive special effects department we have here, okay? Imagine this, and your mug goes here. There's your pitcher, and they put the beer in there. So it comes from a keg. So if you say, "What's on tap?" -- at every bar, in Germany, and other places as well, in Japan, they have these taps, and they pour the beer. You've seen them do that. They pour the beer from there -- not a bottle, which is more expensive. So you go, "What's on tap, man? Give me some good Canadian stuff."

Next, the bartender will probably say -- if you're not talking about beer, which is the first part, but you want other alcoholic drinks, he or she might say, "What can I get you?" You think "get" is "go somewhere", and they're meaning, "Yes, I'm going to leave talking to you, go behind, arrange or make a drink for you, and bring it back." And they usually say, "What can I get you?" Yeah, you're slowing it down now, saying, "What did he say?" "What can I get you?" "What can I get you?" That is, "May I help you? May I serve you?" Cool?</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Okay, James. Product placement right about now. Apple Computers, take one. Hi.  James from EngVid. Yeah. We're getting sponsored by Apple. "Sponsored" means someone is paying you to do something. No, it's not the case. And just so you know, this is the cheap version that's old. One of you guys made a guess last time I held it up. You're like, "It's the Apple 5 with retinal scan!" I don't even know what that is, so don't ask me. Okay? So -- but Mr. E and I, we get to work on my computer, and we're going to tell a story. Mr. E, ready? Okay. So "Mr. E helped to blank blank my new computer. It's not new. It something something well, and we finished early. However, it something something Mr. E had forgotten to pay his electric bill, so the power was something something -- wow, a lot of 'something somethings'. We sat in the -- excuse me. We sat in the dark" -- stop. The end. This is a stupid story. I'm going to try and do a better story. Mr. E, help me, okay? 

Now, Mr. E -- first of all, I should tell you what this is about. I'm giving you five phrasal verbs that are commonly used in conversation that will help you have, you know, a more interesting conversation, but not just that. Because these are used commonly in conversation, you can understand what people are saying because I'm going to try and teach you not just one --no sirree Bob! We're having a sale today. James's sale -- you're going to get two for the price of one meaning, so you can understand this story, but when you're done, you can go back and actually build your own stories or usages, okay? So let's go to the beginning.

"Mr. E helped me to something at my new computer." Well laptops are different. You just put it in a room. In the old days and even now, some people buy big computers, and they have speakers and they have the box and, you know, the big screen. And you have to put it somewhere. Well, when you put it somewhere, you know, you want to arrange or build a system. We call that a "set up". You set it up. It means to put it or arrange it in a way you can use it. You "set up" a business, right? It's a system, you know. You know you buy; you sell -- it's a system. So setting something up is to arrange it or organize it or build a thing that you can use. That's one definition, "set up". What's the second one?" To place somebody in an awkward situation". Interesting. Sometimes you're watching the movies -- I'm sure you watch many of them -- someone will say, "He set me up that so-and-so." Well, what it means is they knew something about the person; they pretended they didn't know; then, they got other people to come around to expose or get the truth out. That's called a "setup". The police "set up" criminals all the time, right? They pretend to buy drugs. They pretend, but they don't actually want to buy them. The criminal sells them, and then they catch them. And they say, "It was a setup from the beginning", and the police go, "Yeah, and you fell for it." When you "fall" for something, you believe it's true even though it's not, okay? So "set up" here means two things: to arrange a system; that's one thing, and that's what we did with my computer system. It's not an awkward situation. We've arranged and built a system, right? So let's set up. Let's go back. Mr. E helped me to set up my new computer. That means we put it on a table, got the speakers, plugged it in, made it work. Cool, right? 

Next, "It w___ o___ well and we finished early." "W___ o___ well" -- what could that be? W-o, w-o. Well, look. See this other arrow comes down here. What does that mean? Well, it means fix a problem -- or couples fix a relationship -- and come to a successful end. Well, what we're talking about is work because when you have a problem you must work, right? To come to a successful end means you must do some work first to come to the end. Running a race; making dinner; fixing a problem. Fixing a problem requires work. Couples have to work on a relationship. And we also have this "this worked out". And if you're like Arnold Schwarzenegger, you have big muscles because you work out. That's my best Arnold impersonation. Okay, so Arnold works out, but that's different. So we also say -- and I should've put it here -- "go to gym", right? Because a lot of times I hear foreign students say, "Teacher, we go exercising now." And I always go, "[laugh] You go exercise. Right." North Americans, English speakers, they "work out". That's what we do when we go to the gym. It is exercising, but that's our word. Be here we say, "It worked out well".</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT

Party of two, your table is ready, party of two. Okay, and these are your drinks, sir. There you go. Enjoy your meal. Bon appétit! 

Hi. James, from EngVid. When I'm not making videos, I need to make money, and this lesson, actually, is about restaurants. I used to be a waiter when I was younger, so I've been in many a restaurant, and I know it might be difficult for you when you -- I mean, you're coming to a new country. I'll slow it down for you because this is basic. You're coming to a new country, and you want to enjoy something. You want to have a meal out of your house. You know -- meal, dinner, or lunch or breakfast. And you go to the restaurant and then somebody walks up to you with, "party of", "table of", "And what would you like for appetizers?" "Would you like an app?" "Would you like this?" "Well, how about your main?" "What about this?" No! Please, don't. So let's slow it down. Let's make it basic, so when you enter a restaurant, you can right away know what they're talking about. Now, there're other things -- you know, we don't have everything in here. There are two other videos on restaurants that you can go watch on EngVid, but this is basic. But even if you think, "Oh, I know all this stuff. I'm very good", you might learn a thing or two. Okay? So come watch. 

So let's start off first. The worm has a drink. One of the first things they're going to come up to you depending -- and see, I don't know if you know this. There's "fine dining", "casual dining", and "fast food". First thing you should know, so where are you going? "Fast food" is like McDonald's, Taco Bell -- [coughs] that's not food -- Taco Bell, Subway -- most of this won't apply, okay? But some of these words, like -- well, we'll get there -- will apply, and I'll let you know. "Casual dining" is like Chili's or Montana's. I mean these are restaurants in the United States and Canada, so don't worry, but it's all similar. It means you can wear something like I'm wearing: jeans -- there you go. I'm getting old. Can't lift that leg up -- or a T-shirt, and it's okay. No one's going to complain, okay? And you can sit down. Not like McDonald's. You can sit down with a knife and fork, and you can eat your dinner. Or -- then you have "fine dining". "Fine dining" is when the people wear what we call "penguin suits". They have a tie and a shirt, and they walk up, and they serve on tables. Okay? But you need a reservation, and it's mucho dinero mis amigos, mucho, mucho dinero. For the rest of you, it's lots of money. "Fine dining" -- "fine" means "expensive", and you usually require a reservation to get a table. So let's just go with casual, because casual is where most can go. Even if you're in a foreign country and there are people who serve tourists, they're going to go mostly to casual, not necessarily fine dining, so I'm sticking with casual, all right?

So casual -- McDonald's we know you just walk in. And here's something -- and McDonald people you can thank me. Next time you go, don't watch them and say, "Give me Big Mac. Give me French fries. And that I want." Try to say, "may I" or "can I have". People who work in the service industry -- which is what the restaurant industry is, where they serve you -- they want a little politeness, so try "can I have" and "may I have". You'll be surprised at how much better they serve you or treat you. Now let's go to the board with the worm, who is providing drinks. One of the first things you come in and you come to a restaurant, they might say to you, "party of" or "table for". And you're going to say, "What?" Well, "party of" -- I know you're not like, "Fiesta time, baby! Yeah, we're going to party, going to be drinking" -- no. What they mean is you are a group of people, and how many are in the group. So "party of two" or "party of four" means there are two -- you can say, "There are two in my party" or four. "There are two of us", or "there are four of us", or ten, okay? Then it's a "partay". It's not a "party"; it's a "partay". Now, "table of" means the same thing, or "table for", "table for". And they mean, for -- I did a video where I talked about "for" means "receive". Go look at it. "For" means "to receive", so "table for four people", so "table for four", "table for five" -- this is four. How many people? That's easy. And that's when they're sitting in the front. That's the first thing they will ask you.

Then they will bring you to your table. And they're going to give you something called a "menu".</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Watch this lesson and learn 3 tricks to make learning English vocabulary, prepositions, and syntax easy, fun, and effective. Well, stop reading and start watching... let's get to the lesson RIGHT NOW! http://www.engvid.com/3-tricks-for-learning-english/

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from www.engvid.com. I'd normally be reading, but I'm putting my finishing touches on. Our expensive prop department -- "props" are things you use in movies to demonstrate things, or a "prop" might be a marker or a pen or a car, right? Our prop department is so poor I had to draw a hat on a box, but it will help demonstrate the 3 tricks to learn English. Now, there are three little tricks that you can do -- and even better, you can do with a friend -- to learn English. So you can actually have partner practice. We haven't really discussed this much here, but why not? I mean probably, you may not go to an English school, so you don't have anyone but your friend who is probably watching with you right now. So here are three quick little tricks you can do, and the beauty of these are - they're going to help you with, No.1, vocab -- vocabulary. Okay? No.2, we're going to work on prepositions. And No. 3, we'll work on structure of English. How's that? You paid nothing, and you're getting lots. And the best thing is they'll all be fun -- fun. Cough, there. 

All right. First thing we're going to talk about is a hat trick. In hockey, a "hat trick" is three things: You score three goals. One, two, and three, just like in English football or European football. Three goals is a hat trick. Don't know why they call it that, but that's what they call it. Our hat trick is called a "hat pull", "hat pull". What's a "hat pull"? Well, you learn your vocabulary, and there's lots and lots of vocabulary. Every day something new. Even when I said things like "hat trick" in this very lesson, there are probably three vocabulary words that you hadn't heard before, that you had to go, "What does he mean?", and I taught you them. But wouldn't it be cool if you had a fun trick to play? A lot of people play flash cards, you know, they get a card. They put the meaning of the word. They turn it over and try and remember. This is a variation that a friend taught me. It's quite fun. What you do is, take your hat, okay? Learn five, ten, words -- 20 even. When you learn them or think you know them, put them in the hat. And you and a friend can then put your hand in the hat and take out the word, and then say something like "philosophy". And the other person has to say, "It's this word. It means this." If they get it right, then they can put their hand in, take out another vocabulary word, and go, "What's this word?" And you can keep playing to help master vocabulary. Cool, right? You're having fun, you're challenging each other. Collect cards. See who wins the game. Or if you're doing it by yourself, just pull it out, turn it over, and try and think of what is the word that's in your hand. It helps to "jog your memory", which is an idiom that means to help you remember or reminds you of the meaning of words. You can play it with one friend, two friends, three friends. That's kind of cool, right? You can even do it in a classroom. Suggest it for your teacher. Go, "Hey, can we play the hat game?" "The hat game? Son, you're too young to play the hat game." You go, "No, Pops, it's a good game." Just get a hat and some paper or tissue paper. Hee hee hee. Sorry. Moving on. 

Next one: I got the hat pull, and you'll see it goes to this one. This is really long: "random sentence generator". And it seems like it's really, really hard. I mean, this one we worked on vocabulary, right? Building your vocabulary, remembering our vocabulary. The second trick, the "random sentence generator" -- I just had to say it twice because it sounds so nice. Well, random sentence. You can use this game to go to this game to make it more complicated or -- and "complicated" means "difficult" -- you can just simply play it by itself. Take a word -- random. Okay, there's a word, "random". Now, "generate" means "to create or make". Make a sentence like that -- random. "He randomly created a sentence from nothing." Right? Yeah, I just took this word and I just made it. I could say, "develop": "In order to develop your mind you have to read many books." I'm going really quickly because I want you to understand that when you do it randomly, it has to be quick. You can't say "blah, blah, blah" very slowly. The whole thing is: speed. This will help you with English structure because if you say it incorrectly, you or your friend will actually notice it and try and correct it. What's the structure? Why can't you put "random" here or there? Is it a verb? Is it an adjective? What is its purpose in a sentence when you're making the sentence?</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Do you know what a prefix is or a morpheme is? In this English class, you will be introduced to six basic prefixes: ad-, syn-, sub-, ob-, in-, and com-. You will learn what they mean and how they change words. Take a quiz on this lesson here: http://www.engvid.com/learn-english-prefixes/

TRANSCRIPT

What am I going to do today? Yeah, I have no -- hi. James from EngVid. You know what? I'm not too sure what to do, so why don't we do something basic? It's not going to really be basic, but I'll tell you what I want to do. I'm going to help you learn how to spell or use prefixes in English. What do I mean by that? The first thing I want to teach you is what is a prefix and the six basic prefixes we start with. That should help you along with your spelling and your reading. Let's go to the board.

Hey, what's up? So what is a prefix? That's the first thing we should look at. Well, "prefix", in itself, has a word, and it's "pre". And funny, it means "before". I've done a couple lessons on this before -- a vocabulary pyramid, so please go check them out -- where I take some of these, and I make a bigger lesson on. So if you're okay with this and you want more, go there, and then do the quiz when you're done. Cool. Anyway, so prefix goes before a word. There are, basically, six basic ones. There are many. There are hundreds, actually. But the ones I'm going to introduce today, you're going to see many, many, many times. And when I'm done, I'm going to give you a little surprise up there. Something that I think will be interesting and surprising. So let's get started, shall we? Let's move towards the board. 

So the first one I want to do means "to" and "toward". You've seen it before, and it does change. What I should introduce also is that -- the fact that a prefix is what we call a "morpheme". A "morpheme" -- because "morph" means "to change" and "pheme" -- it's the smallest unit of English, like, you know, the number one. It's the smallest unit you can have that has a meaning. And that's what, basically, prefixes are. They're small units, but they have a very distinct -- which means a certain or one -- meaning that's special, okay? So these are morphemes, and I'm going to do the first one. The first one is "to" and "toward". What would it be? Well, it means, in this case -- if I put it here, it means "next to", and if I put it here, it means "give to". You've seen it before, and I'm going to put it up here: "ad". Well, think about it: One plus one, you move the numbers together, and you get two. Move them together -- two. That's when we "add" things. Well, funny, that's what it also means as a morpheme. When we put it here, and we put "adjoin": It means "together" or "next to". When you say, "I have -- my bathroom adjoins the living room", it is "next to". They're "toward" or "to"; together. What is this one? Well, you already know I'm going to put "ad" here, right? So let's just add it. I keep saying that, "ad", "add", right? Go towards the next thing. "Administer". When you "administer" something -- your doctor does this. You go; he administers a drug or an injection. It means to give to you. And there's the "to" part. Or "We will administer punishment if you do not do the quiz properly at EngVid." All right? We'll "give" you punishment -- "administer". All right? So let's go to the next one. I love saying "right". It's just correct. 

"With" and together". Some of these look familiar. I know "unity" and "promise". Unity and Ivo -- that's the -- no. That's "Ebony and Ivory". "Ebony". Anyway. Let's go here. But it means "with" and "together". So what could this possibly be? I don't know. How about "com"? "Com" means "with" or "together". And when we put it here -- I made a small joke about "unity", "Ebony", and "Ivory" because I said "living together in perfect harmony" if you see that song. "Unity": They live as one. And then it's "community" -- living as one. One group of people together as one. Now, what about "compromise"? "Compromise" -- have you ever heard that word before? I hope not, or you need a new English teacher. It's "compromise". This changes when you put the "com" in front. I don't make the rules. I'm just here to administer them. You like that? I like it, too. Okay. So when you make a "compromise", you promise together. It means two people want different things, but you say, "Look. You can't have everything, and I can't have everything, so why don't we promise to give each other a little bit of this, a little bit of that?" So we meet halfway. We come together and halfway, right? With a promise, we come and compromise -- halfway, meet each other. "Co" -- you might even say "copromise". So you promise, I promise, we'll make a compromise. You work; I work; we'll get better. Okay, so "co" -- copromise. Don't say "copromise". Please don't. Compromise.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Use this basic English lesson to improve your conversation skills by talking about the things you like to do every day for fun. Learn what spare time, downtime, hobbies, and interests are. I'll also teach you how to explain your passions to others. http://www.engvid.com/learn-english-what-do-you-do-for-fun/

TRANSCRIPT

Hi. James from EngVid. Just looking at my work. I don't know when I'm going to get any more downtime. I mean, I haven't had spare time or time off in so long. I haven't done any of my interests or hobbies and -- you know what I mean, right? You don't? Oh, that's today's lesson. We're going to talk to you about conversation skills and how you can improve them while talking about your downtime, hobbies, and time off. You know? Oh, you don't know? Let's do it, then. Let's go to the board. Well, let's start off with what is a "hobby".

Well, a "hobby" is something -- and you can think of the word "habit". I think most of you know "habit" is something you do regularly. Well, a "hobby" starts with a "h", and it means "something you do regularly". But in this case, it's something that's fun, you do it regularly, and you don't get paid for it. That's what we usually call your "hobby". So you might even spend money and time to do it, but you get a lot of fun from it, and you do it regularly. Now, another word for "hobby" is "interest". And the funny thing about "interest" is that I could say to you, "What are your hobbies?" Or I could say to you "What are your interests?" And it's almost the same. And we use them -- English speakers -- almost interchangeably, which means we can just change them, and it doesn't really matter. But there's a slight difference. Remember "hobby" and "habit" go together -- you do regularly? Well, "interest" means "I like it". Like, I'm interested in the theatre, but I don't go all the time, maybe once every two years. But my hobby is collecting comic books, which means I actually -- every week -- buy the comic books. Like, I have it, and I get enjoyment from both. So remember, you can use the words, but one is more specific, all right? So you could say -- you know, you could say, "I'm interested in reading." -- I don't have time to do it, but I like the idea of it. versus "My hobby is reading.", which is -- that's what I do when I don't have anything to do. All right?

So let's go over here. What kind of hobbies or interests can a person have? Well, one of them is collecting. Now, what does "collecting" mean? It means "to bring together a group of things", all right? But in this case, "collecting" is very specific. Personally, I collect comic books. And I dare you to go back and watch how many videos I've done wearing a Batman T-shirt, and you'll know I'm a real collector, okay? I love Batman. But let's just say I bought Batman No. 1. Now, if I'm a collector, I'll also buy Batman No. 2 and Batman No. 3 and so on and so on. I'll continue to buy. And I will keep them. I'm not going to sell them. I'm not trying to make money, and I'm going to enjoy them as a collector. I will go back after reading them and read them again. Just like when you collect -- we say comics; you can collect books. You can also collect art and music. You guys know -- you collect music. You collect Duran Duran -- right? -- that great group. "Girls on Film" -- oh, I'm old. No, that new guy, Justin Timberlake, yeah? "Mirror" -- yeah. I can't sing that song. But you know what I mean. You can collect music. You can collect art -- Van Gogh, Picasso -- music, again -- Beethoven, Bach, Brahms. Collect and enjoy, right? For yourself or your friends. 

What else can you do? Well, you can also play. And in this case, we're talking about playing sports. I enjoy playing sports. I enjoy playing golf. No, I don't. But sports. You can enjoy playing cards or games. So sports: "I enjoy playing soccer." I'm saying "i-n-g", "I enjoy playing soccer." or "I enjoy playing volleyball at the beach." Right? Cards: "I enjoy playing poker, solitaire" -- "Nobody loves me" because "solitaire" means to be by yourself. Or I enjoy playing poker. Five-card stud, because I'm a stud, baby. Okay. Now -- or games. Now, when I enjoy playing games, right, I can do "gaming". It's a little different. Games can be board games like chess or checkers or Monopoly, and "gaming" -- which we changed to "I enjoy gaming", so you would just say "gaming" instead of "playing", right? "Gaming" -- everybody knows it's electronic, okay? Good. 

Now, "travelling" -- but I'll explain because it seems obvious. "Travelling" means anything outside of your city. If you go to the library in your city, you're not travelling, boys and girls. You're just going to the library. But if you have a big country -- like, I'm in Canada. We like travelling to other parts of Canada because it's like going to Europe. But you can travel in North America. You can travel in Europe.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Are you studying English to do better in business? I would like to point out that the following business English phrasal verbs will help tp bail you out in meetings, and can help you figure out how to make it to the top in your career. Watch this lesson now... before your colleagues figure out your secret weapon: EngVid (and Mr. E.)!!! Take the quiz here: http://www.engvid.com/out-phrasal-verbs/

TRANSCRIPT

"Going out with my baby. Going out to -- " Hi. James from www.engvid.com. Excuse me for a second. Don't mean to make you wait, but I've just got to put down Mr. E because he knows something you don't know about. And what he knows is it's story time. See? He's relaxing, in repose, relaxing. Why? We're going to do some business phrasal verbs, okay? And these business phrasal verbs -- I should explain quickly what a phrasal verb is. It's a two to three-word verb, okay? In which the particle modifies the verb. I prefer to teach particles because usually you know what the verb means. You just want to know how the particle changes it. Right? Cool. So in this case, it's for business because these phrases or phrasal verbs are often used in business. And I want to tell you a story. James is going to tell you a story today. Why a story? I'll tell you the story. I will explain the phrasal verbs, and then you can check after if you understood.

One time, a long time ago -- say, year 2000 -- in a country called America -- and for some people who are complaining about me saying "America", "America" is what we call the United States of America because we live in Canada. British people also call it "America". Foreign people, you have a different way of calling our country, so it wouldn't be common for you to know this. So I can also say, in "the United States of America" they decided -- or actually, they figured out how to make more money and do less work, which they thought was brilliant. So they decided to contract out all of the work from their country to foreign countries. When they contracted out all of this work, some of the other American people that still lived there thought that they had really -- they had sold them out. They thought the companies were sellouts and had sold them out. The companies just wanted to sell out all of their products -- sell out of all of their products and wanted to do it as cheaply as possible. Now, because of that, what little workers remained had to work extra, extra hard, and they got burned out. It was really, really terrible, but the companies still wanted to make money -- wanted to roll out new products. Eventually, in the year 2008, all of these companies, including the banks, needed bailouts. And that's when, 
boys and girls, we paid for all of their decisions that they figured out. 

Now, some of you are going, "What the heck is this guy talking about?" So the first thing I want to do is go over what does "out" mean. Because, I mean, I know you know "contract" or "figure" or "sell", "burn", but maybe you don't know how they are modified by "out". And this is a business -- business phrasal verbs, so let's go to the board, okay? When we look at "out", you can see the arrow is moving. There's a room or something, a building, and the arrow is moving up this way. So the first one we look at is "outward movement". "Ward" means "direction". So it means "direction out", okay? The second means "not being inside". Duh! (In Canada, "duh" means "stupid". So you don't go "duh" because then I'll think you're stupid.) Anyway. Sorry. "You're stupid." -- correct way of doing it. So it means "not being outside". So if you move outside, then you're not inside. Kind of seems obvious, right? It also means "excluding" because anything that's not in the room is not part of the room. So it's "excluded", "not part of", yeah? "Completing": Well, when you close the door, the room is completed, and there's no access to it, "completing". And "doing thoroughly". Okay, you got me. I don't know why "doing thoroughly". It just means "completing". "Doing thoroughly" is similar to "completing". It means "going through the job completely, in all ways". So when you do something "thoroughly", you do it properly, or you do a complete job. They seem similar. Don't worry. I'll explain. 

First, let's talk about "contract out". What does that mean? Well, a "contract" -- you'll notice I have a contract up here. It's a document between two or more parties, saying they will work together, "con" meaning "with", and "tract" means to "pull together". Well, when we contracted -- sorry, companies contract work. What it means is to give a job to somebody outside of your company. So it means people in your company don't get the work; you give it to someone else, okay? So in some instances, some companies decided to make other countries make the product, and they would just sell the product. So jobs were lost because it was "contracted out" -- given to another company...</media:description>

TRANSCRIPT:
[Singing] "Got to buy some dinner tonight." Hi. James from EngVid. So what are we doing? We're going to talk about shopping today. As you can see, I have to go shopping because our budget -- we usually have a big magazine, and I'm down to this poor little piece of paper. But my dinner is on, so why don't we go to the board.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, something we have to do wherever you go. You do it in your own country. We do it here. What I'm going to teach you is the vocabulary for basic shopping. So there -- we have two other videos on engVid that talk about shopping and specific things. You can go and watch those as well. I recommend you do. But for now, just so you can go into a store anywhere that they speak English and get what you want, when you need it, the way you want it, we're going to do this lesson right now. 

So the first thing you want to do is -- well, you want to know if it's on sale. "Sale" means "cheaper price". So that's what we mean, "is it on sale?" The first thing you can ask, like, "Do you have anything on sale?" For instance: Club Savings. All these foods are on sale. Regular price 20, now 17. I'm saving money. So "sale" really means -- s-a for "save". You're saving money because you're going to pay less than the actual, original price. 

Which leads me to the next word: "price" and "cost". For some of you guys you're like, "We know these things." But it's actually using it properly or effectively. You can say, "How much does it cost?" which is different than "price". They're similar -- not same. "Cost" means "what do I have to give you". "Price" is what -- what the actual money is. So you can say, "How much does this cost me?" Maybe two hours. And I'm using it differently than price. So similar -- not same. So what is the "price"; what is the "cost". And they will tell you how much money you have to give them, okay? Cool. 

That comes with the word "pay". When you have a price or cost and you give them money, you must "pay". I work in an English school, and people have to "pay". That means, "Give the money." But you can give not just money, but different things in different forms. So one of the things we can do is, we can use our credit cards. Everybody -- not everyone. A lot of people have it if you're over 18 -- piece of plastic that you give, and they say, "This is worth this much money, and you can use your card to pay with it." Okay? Visa, American Express, MasterCard -- these are credit cards. 
Debit. In North America, we're in love with our debit cards. It's a card that you get from your bank that has direct access to your account. So not like a credit card where the bank is lending you some money or letting you take some money for now, and you pay it back. That's the "credit card". Debit is right in your account, so if you have $500, they literally -- oh, sorry, "literally" means "really", "in reality", or "actually" -- take the money out of your account. So you can use either debit or credit to pay. 

And my favourite, favourite of everyone's -- I don't have any: cash. Cash. Money. The old fashion way of doing things, right? Give them the money -- transaction done. "Transaction" is when you do business. You "transact" because one thing goes to another. You get product; they get money. It's a "transaction", okay? 

Taxes. Every country has them. In some countries, like England -- where they speak the Queen's English -- taxes are included. So if it says $15, it's $15. But folks, I live in Canada. And what you see is not what you get. $15 becomes $16.50. $100 becomes $115. $1,000 is -- $1,150. That's right. Our taxes are not included. So when you come to America or Canada, be careful because you might actually have to pay taxes. You see this, "Incl.": "taxes included". It will be taxes -- it's good. It means price -- what you pay. Most of the times, you won't see anything, and it means "add more money". "Taxes" are what the government gets -- okay. Understand this. It's what the government gets for you buying something because they want their money, too. Anyway.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ Learn these common business English phrasal verbs with "OFF" that will help you understand business and financial discussions in English. These phrasal verbs might even save you some money! I'll teach you the meaning of phrasal verbs like: lay off, rip off, write off, take off, and more. Take a quiz on this lesson here: http://www.engvid.com/off-phrasal-verbs-business-english/

TRANSCRIPT:
London, London, London. Hi. James, from EngVid. Secret London. I was actually born here. Beautiful place. Love it. Now, I want to teach you a lesson today on phrasal verbs. We're going to work on five phrasal verbs.

But this is specific. These are business phrasal verbs, so if you're in business or you're learning about business, these terms will come up regularly. Now, phrasal verbs and idioms in English are used, and you're expected to know them like that. So let's go to the board and see where's Mr. E.

Mr. E wants to teach us something today about "off". Well, the first thing we have to learn, specifically, "off" has about five meanings. But today, we're going to concentrate on two. And all of these ones here are basically going to, you know, relate to those two meanings. "Off" either means to move away from something or to go down. All right? To make smaller or reduce in size. And these phrasal verbs are used in business quite often. If you know anything about what's happened in the last five years, you're going to go, "Oh, my gosh. That's what they were talking about."

So let's talk about the first one, "take off". If you're like me and you work a lot -- I don't work a lot. Okay. I don't work lot. I'm being honest. But sometimes, you need a vacation, and I take vacations. So you need to "take off". But in English, what we say in business, when you go to your boss, and you say, "Boss, I would like some time off." They will say, "Would you like to take some time off?" Or you might say, "I want to take some time off in the summer. I want to take off a month." So you'll hear this phrase "take off" "take off". And it means for vacation. But there's also another meaning, which is really, really good. And this is -- remember; we're talking about "away from" when we're talking about "off" because of "take off". You can see the airplane. The airplane takes off. That's for your vacation because I know you're going somewhere sunny like Canada in January. Anyway. Don't come here in January. It's not sunny; it's cold.

But another thing -- see how the airplane is taking off, so it means it's leaving? Airplanes go up. When somebody goes up and things are going really well, they say, "My business is taking off." It means it's doing well. So your boss might say -- or he or she might say, "I really want this idea to take off because it will be good for the company." It means they want the idea to be successful. If something takes off, it's successful. "We started a new water brand, and it's taking off in Italy." They love it. Canadian water. Who knew? Okay? And it "took off". It means it's successful. It's doing really well.

Now, let's look at another one. This is close to my heart because recently, I found out there's a company across the sea -- imagine a country called "India" -- where they actually took everything about me except my face and my name, and wrote my bio out. It's called a "rip off". But we'll get to that.

If you have a store and you have products --books or markers, okay -- and you see someone come in, and then they take it, and they run out of your store, and they don't pay you, you would say, "I wasn't paid." You can say, "That person ripped me off." That means that person stole from me. And we use that for when someone takes physical objects and takes them without paying from a store. So you can say, "The store was ripped off" because the product was taken and no money was given for it." Okay? That's one form of "to rip off".

Another is if you were the customer or client. If you go to my store and I sell this water for five dollars, and then you walk to Mr. E's store and see the exact same water but more water inside going for one dollar, you'll say, "I was ripped off." It's similar to being stolen from because what it means is, "I paid more than the value of the object." The object is only worth a dollar, but these people made me pay five. I feel ripped off. Something was taken from me, and it wasn't fair. I didn't get the value. Rip off. Water is a rip off. It's free, people. Check the clouds. It comes down regularly. Anyway. Next.

The next thing for "rip off" is to steal an idea. Told you this was business phrasal verbs. Lots of times, McDonald's says, "Burger King's got a new burger. Let's rip it off." And they make the same product, and they call it the McSomething. Burger King did it first; McDonald's steals it.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ What's the "BIG DEAL" about this lesson? Well, if you want to be a "big deal", watch this English lesson and find out when 'deal' is used to talk about importance or a problem. I'll teach you eight different ways to use "DEAL"! Press play right now and say "DEAL ME IN, JAMES!" And don't forget to take the quiz: http://www.engvid.com/speaking-english-deal-expressions/

TRANSCRIPT:
Hi. James from www.engvid.com. And this lesson is brought to you by Eddie Lucas Mens, from Facebook. Eddie, thanks a lot. It seems Eddie didn't know how to deal with it when he couldn't understand when people told him, "Deal with it." So we made a deal to help him learn, okay? And Eddie said, "Deal me in, dude." Okay. So these are idioms that have to do with the word "deal".

Well, first of all, if you don't know what a deal is, none of this is going to make sense. And there're two very important ones you have to know. Funny, the second for the idioms is more important than the first one. And the first one -- well, you can see Mr. E, he's shaking hands with a human. Okay. Because he's as big as a human. Human. I think that's how he sounds when he speaks, "Human make deal with Mr. E." Sounds like a Russian on steroids. Okay. No, just kidding. It's a bad Russian account, I don't know. So, here we go. Here's Mr. E making a deal. It's an agreement, an agreement that must benefit. So when you make a deal, it means "it's good for me; it's good for you." It's a "deal", okay.

When it's not a deal it means something -- one person or a party is not getting something out of it that's good. But funny enough -- and I should say this is the official version when people say, "We made a deal", they're talking about this. But a lot of the idioms really have to do with this one, which is funny: "to give out cards in a game". If you like playing poker -- you know, poker -- and there's, you know, the heart card -- there you go. You play a game. When you play that game you give out cards. And when you give out cards -- when you receive these cards, you have what's called your "hand". And this is what you have to "deal with". And that's what I'm going to explain. This is what you have to "deal with". It's what you have. You don't have anything else. You must make these cards work the best for you, all right? And that's what a lot of these idioms are about.

So let's start with it. You meet somebody. And they're in a bad mood. You might say, "What's their deal?" It means, in that case, "What's their problem?" They got cards and maybe they're, like, "My cards are bad. I'm not happy." And you go, "What's their deal?" Of course, you don't know their deal because you don't know their cards. And that's where I have -- has to do with giving out cards, right? But it's not just for that. When we say "What's his deal, or her deal, or their deal", we mean, "What's their problem, or what's their situation", right? You might see someone drive up in a Mercedes looking good. You go, "What's his deal?" He owns IBM. Stocks in Microsoft -- rich. That's his deal. He got what we call a good hand in cards. Everything is good for him, right? The other problem -- person with the problem -- got a bad set of cards. All right?

So next one, when somebody says, "Deal with it" -- I'm going to go back to the cards analogy. "Analogy" means when you take two things and you try and, you know, you tell a story to explain something else. It's an analogy. It's not necessarily true. It's just to explain something. And I told you at the beginning, and I'll repeat: Most of these will have to do with to give out cards because we talk about fate or what you've been given, and you must use. There will be one about dealing. Don't worry, okay? So when you say, "Deal with it", once again, these are the cards you've got, and you're like, "It's not fair. I don't have the good cards. Johnny has all the good cards." And somebody says, "Deal with it." What they're saying is, "That's the reality. That's the situation. It's your problem. There's nothing we're going to do about it. Stop complaining and just move on from here." Wow. That's tough isn't it? Yeah. Just deal with it.

Next -- remember we talked about cards? "Deal me in." Well, Mr. E's watching the card game. James is playing. He sees me get money, and he's like, "I like that game. I want to be part of that game." Well, then you need your own cards. So somebody has to give you cards, right? That's what we mean by "Deal me in." When you say, "I'm having pizza tonight", and you go, "Deal me in", it means, "I want some pizza. I want to be part of it. I want to join the poker game." It's not poker, remember. It's just -- we're talking about cards, and that word analogy. We're talking about one thing to explain another. So someone says, "Deal me in", it means, "Let me be part of this." Okay?</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ This lesson is the ONLY lesson of its kind! I will do more than JUST teach you English vocabulary. You MERELY need five minutes and will BARELY have to do any work to understand how to use these new words. All you have to do is take the quiz here: http://www.engvid.com/vocabulary-only-just-barely-merely/

TRANSCRIPT:
If only I were a -- oh, hi. Sorry, I was just looking at a picture. I'll put that away. If you've been to Toronto and you know Now magazine, and you know the back of Now magazine -- I'm a bad, bad putty cat. Anyway, this lesson is about "only" and "just". I'm going to give you two more words that we also use, but specifically "only" and "just". Why? Because in English, these two words are used interchangeably. "Interchange" means "to change things", like you take this one, you take that one: Change them in different places.

All right. Between. Because they have similar meanings, it's interchangeable. It doesn't matter that much. This lesson is for -- in case you were bothered by that -- it's our special guy -- it's like the Oscars here -- Allan from the Philippines wrote to us on Facebook, and I wrote it on my Chapters receipt. Anyway, Allan wanted to know what is the difference, and when do you use them. So why don't we go to the board and take a look. 

Ah, Mr. E is here before me. I like making things rhyme. And Mr. E is saying, "James merely has to do 1 lesson and he barely got it on the board. If only I were the teacher". Now, if you read this, there seems to be a limitation or a limit to something. Right. "Merely" means, like, just a small amount. "Barely": also small. And "only": seemingly small. What's the difference? Let's go to the board.
"Just": "I'm just a gigolo, everywhere I go". David Lee, I'm stealing your stuff. Don't sue me. Okay. When we say "just", we use usually -- in English, it means "exactly", "just". "Just five people". "Just to the city", exactly. I'm lying a little bit. We also have "just", and it can be used a little bit like "not that much". Right. "It's just two of us coming for dinner." Not many of us. Exactly two, and it's not a lot. So you have to listen to the context. Okay. When you hear "just", people are saying "exactly", and in some ways they're saying, "and it's not a lot of stuff". Okay. "It's just two dollars". Well how much is it exactly? Well it's two dollars. We don't need to say "just". We say it to say, "it's not that much, relax". It's a tooney. All right. Go to Tim Hortons. Get your tooney, which is two dollars. "It's just two dollars" -- not that much, and an exact amount.

There's another use for "just", okay? And it doesn't follow what the other words we're going to do, but you should hear it or know what it means because it's used a lot for law: "just". It's short for "justice". If something is not fair or not right, not correct, we'll say it is "not just" -- older English. You'll hear it in law, but you won't really hear people say it on the street. "It is not just. I did not get milk with my cookies!" You know, but in a court case they'll go, "We need to be more just in our society", or in university. So you'll see here: "it's not a just decision" -- it's not fair! It's not right, it's not morally right. Morals, you know, like lying and stealing and cheating. "He should go back to court." You hear it in court, okay?

I know you see "merely", but it will be merely a moment before we come back. We have to go here. First the big guys, then the little guys. I said we'd start with "just", now we're going to go to "only". Okay? "Only" has an adverb usage, and it means "limited to". "Only": "Limited to a certain extent". And our example here: "There are only 100 tigers alive." It's limited, right? Adjective use, adjective. "One of a kind". "Only one of a kind", right? "He is an only child". It describes the child. How -- what kind of child? He's an "only" child, like a "big child", a "small child", an "only child". Another use for it: a conjunction. Okay. It's common. You may not see it as such because we use "and" a lot, but we use it because we have this meaning of "limited to" -- I'm going really fast, so I'll slow down so that not only I can understand myself, okay? "Limited to" plus "one of a kind". In this case, it's not just "and", it's an exception, "except that". So we're saying the idea may be similar, but there is a difference. So it's really useful when you're using your English: a conjunction that gives you an exception. Nice, huh? And you thought it was "just" little English we were doing or "only" English. In this case, I would say, she's like my girlfriend, only better. You know, because, like, she's a girlfriend, and she's better, right? "Except that". So that's how we use "only" and "just", okay? Those are the big guns, you know. Those are the ones we use a lot.</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ "A while" or "awhile"? These words sound almost exactly the same, but one is a noun, and one is an adverb. In this lesson for advanced students, I'll teach you when to use each. Even native speakers get this wrong, so it might take a while, but if you watch the lesson and do the quiz, you will get it. http://www.engvid.com/a-while-or-awhile/</media:description>

<media:description>http://www.engvid.com/ In this English grammar lesson, I give you some clear rules you can follow on when to use 'no', and when to use 'not'. After the class, take the free quiz at http://www.engvid.com/how-to-use-no-not-in-english/  Oh, one note: in the lesson, I suggest not using these words in the same sentence. To be clear, they should usually not be used together in the same *clause*.</media:description>

<media:description>In this English lesson, I go over some of the ways in which real native speakers of English say hello and goodbye. When people ask "How are you?", they don't really want to know how you are! They are just saying hello. There are many other ways to say hello and goodbye in different situations, and in this video, I'll teach them to you!

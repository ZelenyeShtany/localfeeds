<media:description>We've featured hundreds of burgers on The Burger Show: all shapes, all sizes, all genres. And while we've made it our mission to preach meat-cheese-bun minimalism, there are certain burgers that make us stop in our tracks and say, "WTF is THAT." Yes, these burgers deserve our attention, too. Without further ado, we present to you the 5 craziest burgers from The Burger Show—including a $777 burger, the world's spiciest burger, an insane Jucy-Lucy, and more!  Thanks for your continued support Burger Squad. We'll see you next year.

<media:description>At its core, a burger is simple: meat, cheese, bun. But when immigrant and first-generation chefs reimagine the burger, it's a whole different story. In today's episode, YouTuber Casey Neistat taste-tests 3 mind-blowing international burgers that reflect the diversity of L.A.'s robust burger scene: a Japanese deep-fried burger from Katsu Sando, an Indian spiced lamb burger (and cheeseburger samosas!) from Badmaash, and a super-spicy Thai burger from the legendary Jitlada. You don't wanna miss this.

<media:description>On The Burger Show, smashburgers are gospel. And over the last few years, this iconic style has exploded in popularity all over the world. For today's challenge, three burger experts are going to teach you three different ways to make a smashburger. Burger Scholar George Motz will be giving a history lesson on the original smashburger. Burger Show host Alvin Cailan is flexing his creativity by making a hybrid Jucy-Lucy smashburger. And cookbook author J. Kenji López-Alt will bridge the crispiness of a smashburger with the juiciness of a thick patty in his burger science experiment. Get ready for your ultimate smashburger master class. 

J. Kenji López-Alt's 'Every Night is Pizza Night' is available here: https://bookshop.org/books/every-night-is-pizza-night/9781324005254?aid=1588&amp;listref=books-by-kenji-lopez-alt

<media:description>Binging with Babish recreates one of the most iconic and endlessly memed burgers in cartoon history: Steamed Hams from The Simpsons. Drawing inspiration from the regional steamed cheeseburger in Connecticut, Babish steams his first burger, while host Alvin Cailan flips the script and invents a steamed patty melt. Did we take this joke too far? Probably! Internet, this one's for you.

<media:description>Mark Calaway is the Undertaker—a 7x World Heavyweight Champion (in WWF and WWE), and one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. His five-part docuseries ‘The Last Ride’ is currently airing on the WWE Network. On November 22 he'll be giving his "Final Farewell" at ‘Survivor Series,’ the same event where he made his wrestling debut more than 30 years ago. How will Big Evil match up in this rumble with the wings of death? Find out how the trench coat-wearing Deadman fares in the scoville inferno known as Hot Ones while answering questions about his early days performing under the name Commando, backstage locker room beef, the zen of motorcycling, Mike Tyson’s impact on professional wrestling, and how he wants his fans to remember him. Will the Lord of Darkness ascend from hell and survive the hottest hot sauces to ever enter the ring, or will he be buried alive in the chicken bone graveyard? From Death Valley… The Undertaker!

Will Thundercat be able to play his way out of this ridiculously spicy gauntlet or is it the end of the world? It’s time to face the music and dance with the scovilles!

<media:description>In the Season Finale of Burger Scholar Sessions, George Motz is teaching you how to cook four regional smashburgers: the Wisconsin butter burger, the New Mexico green chile burger, the Michigan olive burger, and the Montana nutburger. Sometimes regional burgers are defined by a singular topping—and as George shows us, that one topping can be incredible. Keep up with Motz as he guides us through a speed round of regional toppings!

<media:description>In this special episode of Burger Scholar Sessions, George Motz pulls back the curtain on an international street-food icon: the spicy Malaysian egg burger! This burger is so famous that it goes by several names—the Ramly Burger, the Sloppy Burger, and the "Sampah" Burger, which translates to "rubbish" in Malaysia. But this burger isn't rubbish at all; it's a total flavor bomb. Wrapped in an egg and covered with spices, it's one of the craziest burgers George has ever tried. And now he's giving you the tools to make one at home. Warning—it's spicy!

<media:description>Burger Scholar George Motz is here to teach us about another regional specialty from Hawaii—the Teriyaki Burger! This burger is a total flavor bomb and employs a very unique cooking method. Motz not only uses teriyaki  as a condiment, but he also bathes the burger patties in a delicious marinade, amping up the sweet, stickiness that we all love. Add shredded iceberg lettuce and Japanese mayo and you've got yourself a classic regional burger! Here is your Teriyaki Burger master class.

She’s an actress, author, Olympian, WWE Raw Women’s champion and, not to be outdone, she has a successful YouTube channel as well. Wings have always been a part of Rowdy’s post-fight celebratory feast, but how will the “Baddest on the Planet” fare against some of the hottest wings on Earth? Find out how this sustainable ranch owner and judoka takes on the rounds of spice while answering questions about her love of ‘Dragon Ball Z,’ perfect arm bar technique, her days of working at Home Depot, and the appeal of World of Warcraft. Rousey, hands down, has the most efficient and effective wing-eating technique that we have ever seen on Hot Ones, but will the champion tap out or will she take down the lineup?

<media:description>Anthony Joshua and Israel Adesanya have two simple choices in this Hot Ones matchup: tell the truth, or suffer the pain of The Last Dab. Watch as host Sean Evans grills the UFC middleweight champion and the two-time unified heavyweight champion boxer with questions about fixed boxing matches, UFC rule changes, and Dana White’s most annoying habit. Adesanya is also one of the cover stars of EA’s UFC4 which is out now. The only way to escape the truth is to eat an incredibly spicy wing doused with various versions of The Last Dab. Watch as the spice attacks these fighters and battles their taste buds. Can they go round for round with the hot sauce? Find out who will be standing at the end of this heat match.

<media:description>On this week's episode of Tacos Con Todo, Fortune Feimster shows off her improv skills while eating Tex-Mex breakfast tacos. 

The North Carolina-born comedian gives Jesus a masterclass in Southern culture—from what to look for in a good biscuit (it's pronounced "BIS-KIT"!) to role-playing with her Southern housewife character, Brenda (and her good-for-nothin' husband, Tim).  

Enjoy some hearty laughs over Texas' finest brisket tacos and queso!

<media:description>In this first-ever couples edition of Truth or Dab, Karrueche Tran and Victor Cruz have two simple choices in this Hot Ones special: tell the truth, or suffer the pain of The Last Dab. Watch as host Sean Evans grills the star of TNT’s ‘Claws’ and the undrafted free agent turned Pro Bowl wide receiver and Super Bowl champion of the New York Giants with questions about Karrueche’s home cooking, NFL contract negotiations, and celebrity makeup lines. The only way to escape the truth is to eat an incredibly spicy wing. Watch as the heat tests their relationship and destroys their taste buds. And the most important question will be answered—does Victor Cruz watch ‘Claws?’

First We Feast's "Tacos Con Todo" is a new series that shines a light on California's exciting taco culture through the eyes of stand-up comedian and SoCal native, Jesus Trejo. Jesus cut his teeth performing at the iconic venue, The Comedy Store, soaking up knowledge from comedy legends. Now he's inviting some of the world's funniest comics to talk shop over a plate of L.A.'s best tacos.

<media:description>Sean Evans is back to answer as many fan questions as he possibly can in this end-of-the-season recap episode! Who is Sean’s favorite crew member? What are Sean’s favorite TV shows? What is Sean’s favorite hot sauce for personal consumption? Who is Sean the Magnificent? Hear Sean talk about the “absolute graceless chaotic nature” with which guests have been saucing wings in these anarchic times of Season 12 remote shooting. And who were the guests that canceled on Hot Ones at the last minute?! Maybe it all will be revealed in this special Hot Ones fan Q&amp;A. And spice lords, be sure to stay tuned for more from the Hot Ones team this month—nothing can stop us from putting out more content! But really, what this episode is truly about is to say thank you to all the Hot Ones fans from Sean and the entire Hot Ones crew! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

<media:description>Sean Evans breaks down how to play Hot Ones Truth or Dab The Game in the first-ever explainer video for the first-ever play-at-home game! If you haven’t heard by now, the skunkworks over at Hot Ones HQ launched a game version of Truth of Dab that you can play at home (or remotely!) with your friends and family. Fans are always asking how they can do their own Hot Ones challenges at home and sending over creative videos of what they come up with, so the First We Feast crew thought it would be hot and spicy to make a kit to help you play at home. If you want to run the gauntlet and do Hot Ones, you can always pick up all 10 sauces and go to town. But in terms of a game you can play with your friends, Truth or Dab doesn’t require as much research and deep diving, so Hot Ones teamed up with Wilder Toys and Heatonist to make the official Hot Ones Truth or Dab Card Game. And in this video, Sean shows you how to play at home. He goes through all the contents in the game box, which includes 250 question cards and an official mini bottle of The Last Dab (all 2+ million scovilles)! Cameraguy Bill also pops up to show us how to make wings at home. But to really explain to you how the game is played, three Seans sit down to play an epic round that you have to see to believe. Will the Seans answer truthfully or suffer the wrath of The Last Dab?

<media:description>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is an actor, director and producer from films like ‘500 Days of Summer,’ ‘50/50,’ ‘10 Things I Hate About You,’ ‘Looper,’ ‘Premium Rush,’ ‘Inception,’ and many more. He also is the founder of HITRECORD (www.hitrecord.org), an open online community for creative collaboration. He currently stars alongside Jamie Foxx in ‘Project Power,’ which is available now on Netflix. How will he manage against the wings of death in the Hot Ones Season 12 finale? Find out how this lover of Sesame Street, and self-proclaimed Oscar the Grouch (“I am Oscar the Grouch”), takes on millions of scovilles while answering questions about the power of YouTube, his love for the traditional Russian art of clowning, the “American in Paris” mystique (with bonus French film recommendations!), Ugly Kid Joe, the holy grail of his Magic The Gathering card collection, and filming the infamous hallway scenes in ‘Inception.’ But will he get through all 10 wings and sauces in time to make his scheduled appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden?

<media:description>It's the season finale of Coneheads, and Mike Chen is going out with a bang. Feeling nostalgic for one of his favorite food destinations on the planet, Mike decides to embark on a little Italian getaway from the comfort of his home. Teaming up with Food Network legend Giada De Laurentiis, Mike gets a once-in-a-lifetime crash course in Italy's most beloved frozen treat— gelato—from an Italian-American icon. But first, Mike must venture out of his kitchen for a socially-distanced ice cream adventure at Snoqualmie Scoop Shop, where he receives an up-close-and-personal look at how one of Washington State's favorite pints is made.

<media:description>In the Season 2 premiere of Tacos Con Todo, comedian Bert Kreischer shows off his favorite tacos and laughs his head off with host Jesus Trejo. Bert waxes poetic about flour tortillas, while Jesus teaches him about one of the most unique tacos in the world: the Black Al Pastor from Evil Cooks, prepared by two Metalhead taqueros. Get ready as Bert and Jesus trade stories about life on the road, conquering fears, and debate whether a taco should be eaten from the top. (Looking at you, Sean Evans). You won't wanna miss it.

<media:description>These days, if you stick a knife into any object there’s a 50/50 chance it will turn out to be cake. But what if you cut open a cake and it turns out to be ice cream? That’s right. This episode of Coneheads is dedicated to one of the world’s most beloved culinary mashups: the ice cream cake. And who better to teach Mike Chen the ins and outs of ice cream cake-making than How To Cake It’s Yolanda Gampp? Together, Mike and Yolanda team up to create a perfectly messy, candy bar-packed, caramel-and-Oreo-covered ice cream cake creation.

<media:description>Ice cream sundaes are one of the world's most customizable food groups. In the series premiere of Coneheads, Mike Chen and Mythical Chef Josh throw down in an ice cream sundae battle for the ages, pitting Mike's chili oil-topped monstrosity against Josh's fried banana split-inspired masterpiece. Which sundae is the ultimate combination of flavor and creativity? That's for Alex French Guy Cooking to decide. But first, Josh needs to teach Mike how to whip up his own ice cream at home.

<media:description>Dan Levy is the writer, co-creator, and star of the hit series Schitt's Creek, which just wrapped its sixth and final season on PopTV and will hit Netflix later this year. But how is he with spicy food? Despite some words of encouragement from Kristen Stewart, he's not too confident going into his date with the wings of death. As he tackles the sauce gauntlet, Dan discusses Drake, Kanye West's Gap collaboration, sweaters, Jason Biggs, Schitt's Creek easter eggs, and much more.

<media:description>You've seen Mike Chen eat his way around the world on his channel Strictly Dumpling. But for the first time ever the globetrotting glutton will host a brand new show on First We Feast all about ice cream. Premiering July 22, "Coneheads" is a deep-dive into the wide, wondrous world of frozen desserts. From an ice cream truck taste test with Keith Habersberger, to an epic sundae battle with Mythical Chef Josh and Alex French Guy Cooking, Mike is eating every frozen treat he can get his hands on (even an ice cream burrito courtesy of Inga Lam). The ultimate ice cream adventure begins now and Mike can't wait to eat with all of you. It's gonna be legen-dairy!

<media:description>Back in 2016, Eric Andre had one of the most memorable Hot Ones to date, including the instantly iconic "Tinashe, where you at?" line and plates being broken over heads. Now, he's back with his first-ever standup special, Legalize Everything, available now on Netflix, as well as a hidden-camera comedy, Bad Trip, which is likewise set to release on Netflix. And, of course, The Eric Andre Show Season Five on Adult Swim later this year. We know he struggles with spicy food, so you already know that it will be fireworks for round two. Watch as Eric melts down in his own home, chugging milk and screaming non-sequiturs while discussing everything from the genius of Sacha Baron Cohen, to his thoughts on comedy skits on classic rap albums.

<media:description>In our season finale, Burger Scholar George Motz teaches you how to cook a regional specialty from Tennessee: The deep-fried burger!  At a place called Dyer's in Memphis, burgers are smashed paper thin and dipped in a skillet filled with hot beef tallow—a method that harkens back to the dawn of the original hamburger. Grease is an heirloom at Dyer's. When you bite into a burger from there, you're biting into history. That's because the same grease has been used since 1912! Here is your master class for making a Tennessee deep-fried burger.

<media:description>Burger Scholar George Motz is here to set the record straight: A real homegrown Hawaiian burger is NOT a beef patty topped with pineapple and ham. When locals crave a burger, they order something called the loco moco. Technically a 'burger plate,' this regional icon is a burger patty placed on a bed of rice, drenched in gravy, and topped with a fried egg. A popular late-night order at diners, the loco moco is one of George's favorite burgers to eat. And now's your chance to make one at home. Here is your master class on how to make Hawaii's own loco moco burger.

<media:description>A couple months ago, we heard the harrowing tale of how Sean busted his chin open on his coffee table. But what about his permanent scars? This week, our Hot Ones hero breaks down his most excruciating childhood injuries, and even calls in some help from a very special guest—his dad, Mike Evans—to fact-check one of his most painful memories.

<media:description>Burger Scholar George Motz says that if you're ever in Miami, you owe it to yourself to visit Little Havana—a neighborhood known for its iconic regional burger, the Cuban Frita. Served on a Cuban roll and topped with crispy potato sticks, the burger patty is seasoned with Chorizo spices and doused in a secret red sauce. The Cuban Frita is a culinary survivor of the exodus following the Cuban Revolution, and remains one of the great Cuban-American gastronomic expressions. Here is your master class on the Cuban Frita.

<media:description>The double-dipped roast beef burger is an icon of Brooklyn, New York, and Burger Scholar George Motz is here to teach you how to make one at home. This regional one-off burger—known locally as the "Gargiulo"— hails from the historic roast-beef emporium Brennan &amp; Carr. Here, the burger patty is topped with freshly sliced roast beef, sauteed onions, American cheese, and is eventually dunked in a vat of piping hot beef broth.

<media:description>Burger Scholar George Motz teaches you how to cook a hyper-regional slugburger from Northern Mississippi. Borne out of the Great Depression, the slugburger patty combines beef and bread crumbs—a method that was used to extend the meat supply. As the bread crumbs toast on the griddle, they absorb the rendered beef fat, creating the ultimate crispy burger. Here is your master class on how to make a regional slugburger at home.

<media:description>Bert Kreischer is a veteran standup comedian and certified Hot Ones legend. He has a new special on Netflix—the trending "Hey Big Boy"—as well as Bertcast, "Something's Burning" on YouTube, and the "2 Bears, 1 Cave" podcast with fellow friend of the brand Tom Segura. But how will he fare in his rematch against the wings of death? Bert first sat down with Sean Evans way back in Season 2, and now he's making history once again on the first-ever social distancing–friendly "Hot Ones: Quarantine Edition." Hope you enjoy this bonus episode, spicelords!

<media:description>To help raise money for the millions of restaurant workers affected by COVID-19, Binging with Babish, Mythical Chef Josh, and Alvin are teaming up to cook the ultimate teriyaki burger using leftovers as part of the #LeftoversChallenge fundraiser.

Take-out and delivery are the last lifelines for many restaurants and they are urging people to continue their support. That’s why we’re introducing the challenge: Order more take-out from a local favorite than you can eat in one meal, make the most creative dish possible out of the leftovers, post it on social media with #LeftoversChallenge, and challenge your friends to do the same.

If you have the means, please click the button to donate to the Restaurant Worker’s Community Foundation (https://www.restaurantworkerscf.org/). During the COVID-19 outbreak, the organization is distributing 50% of all funds received to direct restaurant worker relief, 25% to non-profits serving restaurant workers, and 25% to zero-interest loans for restaurants starting back up.

Make sure to check out the videos of other participating chefs, including our friends Binging with Babish, Mythical Chef Josh, Joshua Weissman, and Internet Shaquille!

<media:description>Sean Evans checks in from quarantine for a state of the union on Hot Ones. The bad news? No new episode this week due to social-distancing protocols—flatting the curve is more important than flats and drums right now! The good news? We've got some brand-new Hot Ones interviews on deck that are already shot and ready to roll out in the coming weeks. Plus, Sean provides a personal update from his apartment and tells the harrowing tale of his recent fainting spell. We miss you, spice lords—stay safe, stay home, and stay spicy!

<media:description>Last week, Reina Scully ate her way through three of Japan's most recognizable ramen styles. But today, she's on a mission to see where ramen is going next. Her first stop is Niche, where chefs Frank Pinello, Mark Iacono, Carlo Carciotto, and Anthony Vitolo are ready to try mazemen, a saucy, brothless style of ramen. Chef Shigetoshi "Jack" Nakamura calls this dish "Japanese pasta"—but will his cheese and bacon-topped noodles satisfy some of NYC's most beloved Italian-American chefs? And later, Reina heads back to Ramen Shack to eat Keizo Shimamoto's infamous ramen burger one last time. From a discussion of ramen-stuffed pizzas and burritos, to an interview with 16-year-old ramen prodigy Josh Reisner, Reina is seeing how ramen is taking new shape in NYC heading into 2020.

<media:description>Ramen has become one of the world's most ubiquitous comfort foods. But just like burgers or barbecue in the U.S., the dish can change shape depending on the region and the chef. In this episode of Gochi Gang, Reina Scully teams up with ramen obsessive Keizo Shimamoto for a journey through some of Japan's most recognizable ramen styles. From the history of shoyu ramen in Tokyo, to the rise of tonkotsu ramen in Hakata, to the advent of a special dipping ramen called tsukemen, Reina and her friend Sakura Yagi are getting a true crash course in ramen-ology. But what about ramen in the U.S.? Sakura's father, Bon Yagi, breaks down the history of NYC's longest-running ramen shop, Rai Rai Ken, and trail-blazing ramen chef Ivan Orkin explains his unique approach the noodle on the Lower East Side.

A special thank you to the NYC Ramen Enthusiasts Club, featured in the Rai Rai Ken section of the episode.

<media:description>Eel is one of the most traditional ingredients in Japanese cooking. But in the U.S., the delicacy is still largely misunderstood. On this episode of Gochi Gang, Reina Scully is embarking on an eel-eating adventure. First, Chef Hiroki Fukushima gives Reina a crash course in the preparation of unagi, or freshwater eel, at Unagi Aburi Ittetsu. And later, Reina teams up with WWE superstar and sushi obsessive Asuka for an omakase experience centered around anago, unagi's saltwater cousin. Will this deep-dive into the fascinating world of Japanese eel give Asuka the strength she needs to win her next fight? Find out on an all-new episode of Gochi Gang.

<media:description>From a delicately battered piece of tempura to a crispy slab of tonkatsu, Japan is a wonderland when it comes to fried food. In this episode of Gochi Gang, Reina sets out to explore the heart of Japanese fried fare—and there's no better companion than former Man v. Food star Adam Richman. Between bites of pork cutlet, Adam and Reina discuss everything from Japanese puns and good-luck rituals to Adam's own routine before heading into food competitions. But before Reina fills up on tonkatsu, she's heading to Secchu Yokota for an unforgettable tempura experience with chef Atsushi Yokota. From the origins of batter frying in Japan, to the lesser-known tradition of eating KFC on Christmas, Reina is about to embark on the ultimate Japanese fried food adventure.

Which burger will Ludo choose: Brian’s satay-and-sambal-slathered creation, or Joji’s teriyaki-and-shrimp-topped monstrosity? Only one apprentice can become Ludo’s next sous-chef. Find out who wins on an all-new episode of Feast Mansion.

And he's hitting up OG New Yorker Adam Richman to show him the ropes.

<media:description>Jackson Wang is throwing a dinner party to celebrate the end of Chinese New Year. There’s just one problem: Who’s bringing the dumplings? As an international singer, rapper, and dancer, Jackson doesn’t get to do much cooking on the road, so he’s enlisting the help of dumpling masters Hannah and Marian Cheng of Mimi Cheng’s in NYC. From their mother’s secret fried dumpling recipe, to a chili-oil wonton made specifically for Chinese New Year, Hannah and Marian give Jackson a crash-course in all the potsticker protocol. Jackson advances quickly through the steps, but will he receive a passing grade from his friend’s dumpling-loving grandma? Watch this special edition of Food Skills and find out.

<media:description>Bushwick, Brooklyn was once an epicenter for Mexican cuisine in NYC, earning the nickname the “Tortilla Triangle” in the process. Today, Mi Barrio Tortilleria is one of the only tortilla factories that remains, churning out hundreds of thousands of tortillas every day.

In this special edition of Food Skills, owners Miguel and Nelson Carrera give First We Feast an intimate glimpse into Mi Barrio’s decades-long history on Flushing Avenue. Together, the Carreras have successfully transformed a struggling tortilla factory into a booming food-service empire, supplying goods to neighborhood taquerias, as well as Michelin-starred Mexican restaurants. 

Here, as Miguel and Nelson tour Mi Barrio’s production facility and its surrounding neighborhood, the brothers share the details behind their family’s uniquely American success story.

<media:description>In episode 4, MythBusters Tory Belleci and Alvin Cailan are testing a burger robot. When Alvin first heard that Silicon Valley had built the world’s first fully automated burger robot, he knew he had to fly to San Francisco to see it with his very own eyes. Not only to taste the burger, but to race it head-to-head in a burger battle, man vs. machine. And he’s bringing along Tory Belleci to judge whether his years of cooking on the line will pay off.

<media:description>In the Season 3 premiere of The Burger Show, pro-Skater Tony Hawk teams up with Alvin to taste-test iconic burgers, including the Ramen Burger and Impossible Burger. From his ubiquitous video game series to his record-breaking feats at The X-games, Tony's influence is writ large on skate culture. So we thought it was only fitting to have one legend in the skate world judge another set of legends in the burger world. And for good measure, Tony busted out some tricks on the vert ramp with—you guessed it—a burger in hand.

<media:description>Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi—the two brothers who make up the hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd—have two simple choices in this extra-spicy Hot Ones spinoff: Tell the truth, or suffer the pain of the Last Dab. Watch as host Sean Evans drills the rap superstars with high-stakes questions about everything from collaborations they've turned down, to how much the "Black Beatles" creators really know about the original Beatles. The only way to escape the truth is to eat an incredibly spicy wing.

<media:description>"Weird Al" Yankovic is the king of parody songs, with a multi-decade career that includes four Grammys, countless Top 40 hits, and a long list of live shows, including 2019's Strings Attached Tour. But how is he with spicy food? Find out as the "White &amp; Nerdy" icon takes on the vegan wings of death in a very special Hot Ones season finale. As the Scovilles mount, Weird Al shares classic anecdotes about meeting Sir Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, getting co-signed by Kurt Cobain, and inventing the infamous Twinkie wiener sandwich.

Special thanks to Mr. Yankovic's groomer, Sean James!

<media:description>When Anthony Bourdain visited 188 Cuchifritos in the Bronx for an episode of Parts Unknown, he summed up its appeal with one simple proclamation: "I don’t know any place porkier." The old-school lunch counter specializes in Puerto Rican and Dominican cuchifritos, or fried pig parts ranging from ultra-crispy skin (chicharrón), to chewy pig ears and blood sausage. Serving the local community for more than 35 years, 188 Cuchritos offers a stark contrast to the swarms of franchises that have popped up in the neighborhood: hand-painted signs, a loyal army of regulars, and a father-son duo at the helm of the family-operated business. Here, Jose Coto and Jose Jr. tell the story of how the restaurant persevered through the decades and ultimately won Bourdain's co-sign as "the center of the pork universe."

<media:description>Jay Park is a K-Pop heartthrob turned Roc Nation rapper. But these days he's also become an ambassador for Korean drinking culture thanks to his hit single "Soju." Bar snacks—or anjus—are a huge part of turning up in Korea, and Horsepowar is anxious to find out how curry fits into the mix. From curry-infused fire noodles, to Korean-style curry rice, Horsepowar learns the ins and outs of Korean feasting at Toe Bang Cafe in L.A.'s legendary Koreatown. Curated by chef Chris Oh of Seoul Sausage Co., the Korean curry tasting menu culminates with a heaping plate of curry chicken and corn cheese—a unique spin on a dish that's been blowing up Instagram feeds in 2018. How will K-Town curry stack up to other bowls Horsepowar has tackled this year? Find out on the SEASON FINALE of the Curry Shop.

Joined by Crazy Rich Asians star Ronny Chieng, Horsepowar gets a crash course in Malaysian-style feasting at Hometown Hot Pot &amp; BBQ in Chinatown. While breaking down communal dining etiquette and DIY barbecue techniques, Ronny explains how Indian, Chinese, and Malay flavors combine to form one of the world's most diverse culinary traditions. Complete with a hot pot master class from Mike Chen, Horsepowar goes from Malaysian-soup simpleton to curry-broth boss in the course of a single afternoon.

Well, everyone's about to find out—including Yachty himself. After a life completely devoid of spice, the Atlanta icon cannonballs into the hot-sauce deep end, trading in his usual meal of pepperoni pizza for 10 scorching hot chicken tenders. Along his experimental journey in Scovilles, Lil Boat reflects on his beefs with Ebro and Joe Budden, discusses his gaming habits, and explains why his 21st birthday was the best day of his life.

<media:description>Sushi and ramen might get most of the shine in the U.S., but in Japan kare raisu—or Japanese curry rice—is practically a national obsession. A little sweet, a little savory, and poured over deep-fried cutlets of meat like gravy, Japanese curry is a quintessential comfort meal. To find out more about Japan’s rich curry tradition, Horsepowar teams up with Japanese-British pop singer Rina Sawayama for a three-course introduction at Suki in Manhattan’s East Village. From the classic chicken katsu curry, to more unique takes on the dish—like curry ramen and a cheese-topped yaki curry—Horsepowar eats her way through Japan’s curry fixation. Thanks to a surprise visit from Emmymade in Japan, our host gets a full picture of Japanese curry culture, from specialty restaurant recipes, to the instant roux blocks used to make curry at home.

<media:description>Sean Paul is a dancehall icon and certified hit maker. But he’s also a ride-or-die obsessive when it comes to the food of his native Jamaica. Anxious to learn more about Jamaican curry goat, Horsepowar follows Sean and his latest Dutty Rock signee, Chi Ching Ching, to Glady’s Jerk Center in Brooklyn—a new-school home for Caribbean cuisine on Rogers Avenue. From a crash-course in patois, to a heated beef-patty taste test, Sean and Chi Ching school Horsepowar on all things Jamaican before diving into a couple heaping bowl of curry goat and oxtail. The Curry Shop heads to the Caribbean this week, and who better to breakdown the dos and don’ts than two generations of dancehall legends? Jeesam peas!

<media:description>Indian food has been lumped in the “cheap eats” category for decades in America. But in NYC, there’s a rich tradition of high-end Indian restaurants that challenge this stereotype, serving up inventive South Asian cuisine in a white tablecloth setting. To help Horsepowar learn more about the world of Indian fine-dining in New York City, she’s teaming up with the hilarious actor, comedian, and “Daily Show” vet Aasif Mandvi. At Junoon, a Michelin-starred Indian restaurant in Manhattan, Aasif and Horsepowar sample some of chef Akshay Bhardwaj’s most creative dishes while discussing spice, price, and the stereotypes that still surround “ethnic” cuisine in the U.S. in 2018. From ghost pepper-laced tandoori chicken, to a massive, curry-topped lamb shank, Horsepowar gets a crash-course in Indian haute cuisine from a certified comedy legend.

<media:description>It takes years of training to become a sushi master in Japan. But can Brian and Joji master the craft in time for their party tonight? Joined by Yoya Takahashi, the beloved sushi chef behind L.A.'s Hamasaku, the guys learn how to serve up omakase-grade fish from the comfort of their Hollywood Hills party pad. From slicing slivers of sashimi to molding perfect pieces of nigiri, chef Takahashi schools his young pupils on the basic principles behind one of the world's most respected culinary traditions. After Joji and Brian prove themselves to be promising students (well, one of them anyway...), chef Takahashi breaks out the crown jewel of his menu: live prawn topped with gold flakes and uni. Find out if Brian and Joji have what it takes to make it behind the Hamasaku sushi counter in an all new episode of Feast Mansion.

<media:description>Welcome to the Curry Shop: a new weekly series that explores one of the world’s most misunderstood comfort foods. From Japan to Jamaica to China to Vietnam, every culture has its own spin on a bowl of curry—and Indian-Canadian rapper Horsepowar is here to sample them all. 

The first stop on Horsepowar’s quest is the Philippines. To help Horsepowar answer some of her burning curry questions, she’s teaming up with the hilarious Filipino comedian and food philosopher Jo Koy. At Maharlika in NYC, Jo drops some knowledge about Bicol Express—a spicy, coconut-based stew that bares a striking resemblance to some of the curries Horsepowar has sampled in her travels. But the feast doesn't end there: From remixed chicken and waffles, to 7-Up–cured pork tenderloin, Jo and Horsepowar also explore the cultural roots of Filipino fusion before making a final verdict on Bicol Express. Is Bicol Express truly a curry? Is curry really just a stew? Find out the answers to these existential food queries on the series premiere of the Curry Shop.

<media:description>Curry is one of the world's most ubiquitous comfort foods, but also one of its most misunderstood. In "The Curry Shop," a new weekly series premiering October 8 on First We Feast, Indian-Canadian rapper Jasleen Powar—a.k.a. Horsepowar—examines how South Asia's most famous culinary export changes shape from Japan to Jamaica to Thailand to the Philippines. Joined by celebrity guests like Aasif Mandvi, Sean Paul, Chi Ching Ching, and Rina Sawayama, Horsepowar explores the connections between hip-hop, spice, and global cuisine while sampling some of NYC's finest bowls of curry. Dropping every Monday at 11 a.m. EST, “The Curry Shop" is one woman's journey to better understand her own culture through the lens of food.

<media:description>Hot Ones alums Joji and Rich Brian are tired of being on the receiving end of fiery chicken wings. Hoping to make a splash at their new L.A. party pad, the guys decide to team up with Howlin' Ray's chef Johnny Zone for a crash-course in all-things spicy chicken before their inaugural bash. Homesick for Jakarta, and craving some familiar food, Brian asks Johnny to put an Indonesia spin on one of his favorite meals, cooking the wings in coconut water and topping them with a searing, ghost chili-laced sambal. Will Joji and Brian earn a spot on the Howlin' Ray's line after their tutorial, or leave the kitchen with third-degree oil burns? Find out out on the SERIES PREMIERE of Feast Mansion. Shout out to Owen Wilson!

<media:description>Joji and Rich Brian are celebrating 88rising's Head in the Clouds album and getting ready for their upcoming tour by partying in the Hollywood Hills. There's only one problem: Who's going to bring all the food? In "Feast Mansion," a new series premiering September 26 on First We Feast, Brian and Joji are determined to feed their friends by any means necessary. Whether they're getting roasted by French omelette master Ludo Lefebvre, or learning how to grill rattlesnake and bulls testicles poolside with a yakitori master, the labelmates put their cooking skills to the test before heading out the 88 Degrees and Rising Tour this fall. The result is a gonzo, no-holds-barred take on a stand-and-stir cooking show, combining DIY Asian feasts with the energy of a rap video. Will Joji and Brian throw a summer blowout for the history books, or burn the kitchen down? Watch Feast Mansion every Wednesday at 11am EST to find out.

<media:description>Sushi and beer pairings get an upgrade in the season finale of That's Odd, Let's Drink. Instead of drinking cans of industrial lager with takeout California rolls, brewmaster Sam Calagione attempts to match Japanese and American brews with some of the greatest hits from the omakase menu at Shuko, one of NYC's most acclaimed sushi bars. Joining the micro-pairing adventure is musician Julianna Barwick, who brewed a sushi-inspired, wasabi-infused beer called Rosabi with Sam a few years back.

<media:description>Sean Evans is the perfect guinea pig for one of Dogfish Head brewmaster Sam Calagione's craziest recipes to date: In Your Mace, a pepper spray-infused stout custom-made for someone who has eaten the spiciest wings on the planet. Before unleashing this diabolical creation on Sean, Sam warms him up with a crash course in how to pair spicy foods with beer. Then, the duo decides to kick things up even further by running the Mace-spiked beer through a special contraption stuff with Carolina Reapers, Chocolate Bhutlahs, and a boatload of other peppers from chile guru Smokin' Ed Currie.

<media:description>Surprise! Even though Season 6 just came to a close last week with Jeff "Daddy" Goldblum, we couldn't truly close it out without an extra bonus for the fans: the long-awaited reunion special with one of our favorite all-time guests, Eddie Huang. Last time, Eddie infamously started his spice journey at level 10, crashing and burning in epic fashion. For his second showdown with the wings of death, he brings a different strategy to the table and talks about everything from Anthony Bourdain's mentorship, to outrageous chef fashions. Welcome back to the hot seat, Eddie!

But before they attempt to find the ultimate beer-drinker's yoga pose, Sam takes Bert on a trip down memory lane via a tasting of retro regional lagers.

You know them from Buddy System on YouTube Red, and as the hosts of Good Mythical Morning, now entering its 14th season. And you already know how they are with hot food, since they've eaten the Carolina Reaper on their channel, just like Sean Evans and Chili Klaus. But you haven't seen them climb Mount Scoville while taking on questions covering everything from their infomercial days, to the secrets they've never shared with each other. Strap in for another BFF barn burner of an episode!

<media:description>Dogfish Head founder Sam Calagione heads to Oklahoma City to celebrate Record Store Day and craft beer with indie-rock legends The Flaming Lips. In addition to tasting a couple extra-special collaboration brews, Sam and lead singer Wayne Coyne discuss their own offbeat collaboration called Dragons &amp; Yum Yums—a tropical pale ale packed with dragonfruit, yumberry, passionfruit, and black carrot juice. With the ingredients of the beer as his muse, Coyne wrote lyrics for a special release called "The Story of Yum Yum and Dragon," pressed into super-limited vinyl records injected with the beer itself. There's music in the beer, and beer in the music...literally.

<media:description>YouTube juggernauts and taste-test kings Rhett &amp; Link join the season 2 premiere of "That's Odd, Let's Drink It" to sample some of the craziest beers in the craft-brewing movement today. The series follows Dogfish Head founder Sam Calagione's quest to sit down with the folks who inspire him most—from The Flaming Lips, to Bert Kreischer—for off-centered, educational beer tastings. Sitting down in Good Mythical Morning HQ, Rhett &amp; Link challenge their palates with a beer made with human saliva, a super-charged stout, and a very special sour-beer experiment.

<media:description>Daisuke Nakazawa is one of the most important figures in New York sushi. But before he was making a name for himself in the West Village, the chef was studying as an apprentice at Sukiyabashi Jiro, the three Michelin-starred restaurant helmed by sushi master Jiro Ono. Today, chef Nakazawa has moved out of the shadow cast by Ono—as well as the cult-favorite documentary, Jiro Dreams of Sushi, which catapulted the pair to international fame—to create his own omakase experience in Manhattan. Combining his own creative ideas with the tradition of Edomae-style sushi in Japan, Nakazawa's New York-mae menu is an ode to the city's mounting influence on the beloved, centuries-old delicacy. Here, chef Nakazawa explains his unique approach to sourcing, butchering, and serving slivers of some of the world's finest fish. From the importance of using fresh wasabi and ginger, to his 10-step approach for crafting a flawless piece of nigiri, chef Nakazawa unlocks the keys behind his world-famous sushi like never before.

<media:description>Al Roker is the longtime host and weatherman at NBC's The Today Show, a best-selling author, 13-time Emmy winner, and sandwich-maker-in-chief of the new web series Cold Cuts. But how is he with hot food? Find out as the TV legend sits down for a date with the wings of death and weathers a storm of hot questions from host Sean Evans. This episode has it all—hilarious reactions to Al Roker rap references, some savage snaps on cameraman Bill, a critique of Sean's weatherman audition tape, and some inside baseball on David Letterman's early-career hijinks.

<media:title>Detroit Pizza Gets a New York Twist From These NYC Slice Masters | Food Skills</media:title>

<media:description>New Yorkers are territorial when it comes to their slices. So when two Staten Island pizza legends decide to open up a Detroit-style pie shop in the heart of Manhattan, you know they better have a good reason. Enter: Lions and Tigers and Squares—a Detroit-style pizza parlor “with a New York twist.” For Francis Garcia and Sal Basille, the masterminds behind NYC’s Artichoke Basille’s Pizza, the obsession with Detroit-style pie came from a trip to the Motor City in 2013, where they got a crash-course in the town’s unique approach to cheese, sauce, and dough. Now, on the corner of 8th Avenue and West 23rd Street in Chelsea, the cousins are churning out square pizzas with the best of them, covering their dough with heaps of fresh cheddar cheese and baking it all in a pan. The result is something crisp, cheesy, and decidedly untraditional, as far as purists from both cities are concerned. "Detroit is a pizza city. I mean, come on. People forget that," Garcia says. "It was a combination of loving the way that it tastes, loving the way that it looks, and loving the way that it came about."

<media:description>To be a real burger pro, you have to understand different ways to dial up flavor. Attaining Burger Lord status involves more than just a fancy cast iron or spatula. It involves science. That’s why Alvin is teaming up with food scientist and Museum of Food and Drink founder, Dave Arnold. Dave’s going to to pull back the curtain on essential scientific concepts—things like umami and the maillard reaction—that will help you make the perfect burger.

<media:description>Fried chicken is a comfort-food staple the world over, and Japan is no exception. Generously battered in potato starch, double fried in a skillet, and marinated in a mixture of soy sauce and mirin, Japan's chicken karaage is renowned for its extra-crispy skin and juicy meat. At Bessou, Maiko Kyogoku and Emily Yuen infuse the dish with their NYC sensibilities, seasoning the chicken in a dusting of global spices, with nods to Korea to the Middle East. For Kyogoku—who in a past life worked with the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami and managed his relationships with the likes of Louis Vuitton and Kanye West—the blending of cultures has practically become second nature. "Bessou means 'home away from home,'" she explains. "We want people to enjoy and share and not have too many formalities and pass the dishes around like you would at home."

<media:description>If you want to understand the soul of L.A.’s burger culture, you have to head to the Apple Pan. The 70-year-old West Side burger counter embodies the burger in its purest form—served at a counter and wrapped in paper by life-long staffers. Few people can talk about what makes this place special more than burger scholar George Motz. In today’s episode, Alvin and the roving Burger Lord are going to dig into why the Apple Pan deserves to be called one of the best burgers in America.

<media:description>For those craving the fresh ingredients of Naples, but aren't in the mood for Neapolitan pizza’s ultra-puffy crust, Salerno-style pies might be the ideal way to combine cheese, dough, and tomato sauce. Named after Salerno’s area code, and helmed by celebrated chef Roberto Paciullo, Zero Otto Nove is one of the few restaurants in NYC specializing in the southern Italian city’s unique approach to pizza-making. In this continuation of Food Skills’ deep-dive into NYC’s “real” Little Italy in the Bronx, chef Paciullo explains how his Salernitano pizza has become a surprise hit on the corner of Arthur Avenue and East 186th Street. Cooked extra crisp, and topped with Salerno-specific ingredients, like anchovies and capers, the pizza at Zero Otto Nove is both comfortingly familiar and exhilaratingly unique. Pairing ocean flavors with basil and olives, the restaurant’s signature Marinara pie is a must-try for thin-crust pizza lovers everywhere.

Mozzarella isn't just a cheese, it's a work of art—at least the way it's made at Casa Della Mozzarella in the Bronx. Located on the corner of 187th Street and Arthur Avenue, the beloved Italian deli is helmed by father-son duo Orazio and Carlo Carciotto. Armed with little more than a pot of boiling water, a few pinches of salt, and an old wooden oar, the Carciottos pride themselves on turning blocks of lifeless cheese curds into molten cascades of creamy mozzarella. The shop is a stalwart in the Belmont section of the Bronx, and Carlo, in particular, was raised in the Italian enclave of Arthur Avenue—a strip of storefronts and restaurants increasingly referred to as NYC's "real" Little Italy. In this special installment of Food Skills, Carlo gives a behind-the-scenes tour of one of New York's most legendary neighborhoods, while Orazio breaks down the secrets to his uniquely American success story. In NYC, it's not difficult to a find a delicious pizza margherita, or a mind-blowing chicken parmigiana, but here, at Casa Della Mozzarella, cheese isn't just an ingredient, but a bucket-list meal all its own.

<media:description>Burgers are universally beloved because they're the food of the people. But few can deny the appeal of secret, off-menu burgers—a concept that was popularized by the GOAT fast-food chain, In-N-Out. With the obsessive demand for Animal-style burgers, other fast-food chains like Shake Shack and Five Guys have taken note, creating more competition in the field. So which fast-food, off-menu burger reigns supreme? Alvin is linking up with his friend and burger lover, Seth Rogen, to crown a winner.

<media:description>The world is overflowing with noodle soups. From ramen to udon to mixian to pho, every culture seems to have its own preferred method for slurping up a hot bowl of broth. But in Taiwan, devouring bowls of beef noodle soup borders on a regional obsession. At Manhattan’s Ho Foods, the dedication to the art of the BNS is so pure that the restaurant has purged all other dishes from its menu, altering only the width of its noodle to fit customers’ particular palates. Boiled down for 24 hours, and topped with red-braised beef shanks, the soup is a simple, working-class dish that’s perfectly primed to appease NYC carnivores in 2018. From the dish’s humble begins in Asia, to its proliferation in California’s San Gabriel Valley, to its new home on 7th Street in the East Village, chef-owner Richard Ho charts the fascinating history of one of the world’s most beloved bowls of soup. "We were just embedded and soaked in Asian culture," Ho says of his upbringing near Los Angeles. "This is how we grew up eating, and we wanted to share that with everyone in New York City."

<media:description>It’s no secret that Los Angeles has minted stars in the burger world. But for many natives, it’s the homegrown, backyard burger traditions that keep the burger scene here alive and well. Just ask Alvin, whose childhood growing up in East L.A. is filled with memories of grilling burgers on Sundays and watching the area’s famous lowrider clubs cruise the boulevard. Today, he’s linking up with Together Car Club to talk shop about the communal power of backyard burgers and why lowriders and grilling go hand-in-hand.

<media:description>Pho is one of the world’s most beloved noodle soups. But how do you get the most out of your bowl? Jimmy Ly, chef-owner of Madame Vo in Manhattan’s East Village, is here to breakdown the rice-noodle commandments. From adding garnishes like beansprouts and basil, to the proper application of condiments like sriracha and hoisin, Jimmy lays out a plan of attack as only a seasoned pho fanatic could. And when it comes to the signature pho at Madame Vo, a well thought out strategy is practically an imperative. Inspired by the sweet, fragrant bowls found in Southern Vietnam, the restaurant’s 24-hour broth comes overflowing with meatballs, brisket, and a massive hunk of fall-off-the-bone short rib. It’s a dish inspired by the flavors of Southeast Asia, as well as the cooking Jimmy grew up eating in his mother’s kitchen in Queens. Rich, decadent, and packed with flavor, the pho at Madame Vo is a must-try for novice noodle-lovers and Vietnamese food experts alike.

<media:description>Walk into any slice shop in New York City and a pizzaiolo will claim to specialize in Neapolitan pizza. Naples’ singular approach to the dish has become a shorthand of sorts for any pie that seems to be thin, flat, and round in 2018. But at Una Pizza Napoletana, chef Anthony Mangieri is using imported ingredients and traditional cooking techniques to pay homage to his Neapolitan ancestry, all while creating a product that’s uniquely rooted in the five boroughs. Topped with buffalo mozzarella, San Marzano tomato sauce, sea salt from Trapani, and olive oil from Sorrento, each pie from Una Pizza Napoletana is a carefully orchestrated opera of flavor, the pieces blending together to form one perfectly balanced work of art. 

A fixture in the NYC slice game for decades, Mangieri made a name for himself as a savant-like pizza purist hellbent on perfection. Today, returning to Manhattan after years on the west coast, the chef just wants to make a pizza that perfectly represents his own unique tastes and experiences. "For me, at this point in my life, I don’t think the pizza is the best. I think that it’s just mine and it’s what I offer," Mangieri says. "That’s what I bring to New York. I bring myself and my ideas and my independence."

<media:description>Creating the perfect pancake is both a science and an art form. Mix the ingredients too long and the batter starts to run on the griddle. Flip the flapjack too late and the cake can lose its golden-brown finish. Overload the stack with toppings and the hotcakes becomes a soggy mess of molten maple sugar. Yes, the road to mastering one of the world's most beloved comfort foods is paved with the careful measuring of ingredients and more than a touch of baker's intuition. At Clinton Street Baking Co., one of NYC's most popular brunch destinations, chef-owner Neil Kleinberg has pushed the pancake to pillowy new heights. Stuffed with pumpkin, banana, and chocolate chips, and smothered in a rich, house-made maple butter, the fluffy stacks at Clinton Street Baking Co. are the platonic ideal of what a pancake should be.

<media:description>It's that time again, spicelords: The changing of the Scoville guard, hot-sauce draft day, the christening of the all-new Wings of Death! The Season 5 hot sauce lineup served us well, breaking down guests like Charlize Theron and Michael B. Jordan to their realest selves, but in this crazy game called Hot Ones, evolution is necessary. And so it is with great excitement and fanfare that we usher in the Season 6 lineup, which includes a whopping nine new sauces on the board, including Los Calientes and a never-before-seen, extra-extreme version of the Last Dab. Watch Sean Evans break down the scorching-hot lineup, then get your own wings of death ready in time for next week's Season 6 premiere on June 7.

<media:description>After turning heads in Tokyo and flooding Instagram feeds in the U.S., Japan's legendary wagyu katsu sando has finally landed in the states. Sold at SakaMai in NYC for a whopping $85 a pop, the ultra-luxe steak sandwich is a flashy dish that seeks to transcend the usual trappings of Internet-famous foodstuffs. Made with A5 Miyazaki wagyu—some of the finest beef produced in Japan—the dish takes a beautifully marbled piece of meat and cranks the decadence up to 11, deep frying the fillet in panko breadcrumbs before slathering it in a Worcestershire-like sauce. Merging steakhouse extravagance with deli-counter convenience, the sizzling beef is served between two delicate slices of Japanese milk bread. Whether you're a Japanese beef aficionado or just thumbing through your IG, the wagyu katsu sando is a bucket-list item for steak lovers everywhere.

<media:description>Calzones are one of the world's most beloved filled foods. But which ingredients make for the perfect stuffed pizza? Andrew Rea—the mastermind behind the wildly popular cooking channel, Binging with Babish—is here to face off against Sean Evans in a calzone cook-off for the ages. That's right, it's the season sendoff you've been praying for. In typical Binging with Babish fashion, Andrew whips up a Seinfeld-inspired pizza pocket, filled to the brim with the kind of cheese, pepperoni, and eggplant wolfed down by George Costanza. It's a difficult dish to beat, but Sean has an unlikely ace up his sleeve—a calzone clone of one of America's favorite Tex-Mex meals: The Cruchwrap Supreme. Will Andrew's sitcom special be enough to impress legendary pizza man Mark Iacono, or will Sean break his losing streak and finally bring home a W from Lucali? Find out on the very special, Season 2 finale of Sean in the Wild.

<media:description>More than a few fights have broken out at the dinner table over the last corner piece of lasagna. Coveted for its crispy edges and slightly burnt layers of sauce and cheese, this slice far surpasses the soggy consistency of the center square. At Don Angie, one of the more exciting Italian-American restaurants to open in NYC in recent years, chef-owners Angie Rito and Scott Tacinelli have devised a way to give each piece of lasagna the crispy blanketing of marina are robiola it so justly deserves. By rolling each sheet of pasta, cheese, and sauce into a pinwheel-like spiral, Don Angie makes sure every piece comes out of the oven cooked evenly to a golden-brown hue. Whether you're a traditionalist who only enjoys nonna-approved recipes, or an adventurer who tries every pasta that pops up on your Instragram feed, the lasagna for two at Don Angie perfectly blends the culture of old-world Italian cooking with the charm of the new.

<media:description>Hot Ones Season 5 is in the rearview mirror, and Season 6 is on the horizon. But before we officially bid farewell to Charlize Theron, Michael B. Jordan, and the rest of the SZN5 gang, it's time for that great Hot Ones tradition: the extra-spicy fan mailbag! Sean Evans takes a seat in the newly christened Hot Ones Museum of Curiosities—featuring a collection of tchotchkes and memorabilia from our favorite guests—to answer your burning questions. Stay until the end for an epic, One Shining Moment-style montage of the season that was. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and as always, you'll get an uncontrollable urge for violently hot chicken wings.

<media:description>Sean in the Wild has been serving up cooking tips and culinary knowledge darts for 50 episodes. And what better way to celebrate this milestone than with a good ol' fashioned clip show? Here, Sean Evans takes viewers on a trip down memory lane, looking back at 10 of the most memorable moments from nearly 500 minutes of cooking tutorials, kitchen battles, and taste-tests. From a crash-course in chicken feet with Mike Chen, to a knife-skills bootcamp with Rachael Ray, Sean has spent the last two seasons leveling up his culinary know-how by any means necessary, and asking for help from some very special friends along the way. Now it's time to sit back, relax, and stop telling Sean he doesn't know how to cook!

<media:description>Dripping in sauce and covered in cheese, veal parmigiana is not only a staple of  Italian-American cooking, but one of the world's great comfort foods. At Emilio's Ballato—a last vestige of Manhattan's old-school Italian eaters—the veal parm is a dish made to appease the New York appetite: breaded, pan fried, and coated in a heavy blanketing of melted buffalo mozzarella. Each night, the restaurant's executive chef, Anthony Vitolo, prepares the plate-sized cut of meat as if he's cooking for his extended family. And though Emilio's Ballato is often slapped lovingly with the label of "red sauce joint," the trattoria excels well beyond the basics of marinara and meatballs. Still, as restaurants around the city continue to embrace the high-end and haute, the veal parmigiana at Emilio's Ballato is a must-try for Italian food-lovers the world over.

<media:description>Hot Ones may be in between seasons, but we couldn't leave you without your regularly scheduled hit of hot wings. So, just for the real ones out there who have been asking, we're dusting off a Hot Ones classic! During our PBR Halftime Show, Machine Gun Kelly—one of the O.G. Hot Ones guests, and inventor of the dab—made his return to the table for a second date with the wings of death. His heroic, post-wings musical performance was a game day-only special, but now you can relive the magic of the interview.

<media:description>Few pastries are more quintessential to the New York experience than the cannolo. Sweet, flakey, and filled with a thick ricotta cream, the Sicilian dessert is the platonic ideal of what fried food can be. Ferrara Bakery in Manhattan's Little Italy has been churning out the pastry for over 125 years, since Antonio Ferrara first opened up shop on Grand Street in 1892. Now, fifth-generation owner Ernest Lepore is here to share the secret to making perfectly smooth and crunchy cannoli in Ferrara's legendary kitchen. Whether they're dragged through a vat of melted chocolate, or served plain with an espresso, cannoli are an inextricable component of Italian-American cooking in NYC. "I love cannolis, because it's my family tradition," Lepore says. "Sharing food is the way we say we love you, so we love to cook."

<media:description>Sick of being asked to guzzle maple syrup and chug liters of cola, the cast of "Super Troopers 2" is here to taste test one of America's most treasured culinary traditions: frozen pizza. Fresh off the 4/20 premiere of their stoner-classic sequel, the Super Troopers crew is determined to find the best freezer-aisle slice for when those late-night munchies hit. From classics like DiGiorno and Ellio's, to an artisanal frozen pie from the folks at Roberta’s in Bushwick, Sean Evans is rolling out some of the country's most beloved heat-and-eat pizzas. Is DiGiorno really as good as delivery? Does Tombstone Original have a faint taste of snozberry? The guys answer these important questions—and more!—on an all new episode of Sean in the Wild.

<media:description>Chicken and waffles are one of the world's great culinary odd couples. A perfect pairing of savory and sweet, the dish is rooted in the tradition of Southern soul food, and popularized by chains like Roscoe's in L.A. But some might be surprised to learn that chicken and waffles were actually first combined in Harlem, a product of the jazz clubs of the 1920s. Now, nearly a century later, NYC's Sweet Chick is using the dish as a blank canvas for blending regional flavors, covering its chicken and waffles in everything from Nashville-style seasoning, to tangy General Tso's sauce. While Sweet Chick might not be ground zero for chicken-and-waffle purists everywhere, owner John Seymour seeks to capture the cultural landscape of NYC in 2018—bringing hip-hop and comfort food together at locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and now Long Island City, Queens.

<media:description>Instant ramen is one of the world's most ubiquitous cheap eats. But which international noodle brand reigns supreme? To help Sean Evans unpack the increasingly intricate world of mass-market noodle bowls, he's enlisted the help of Andrew and David Fung, the stars of the wildly popular YouTube channel Fung Bros. While taste-testing noodles from across East Asia, Sean, Andrew, and David slurp up instant soba from Japan before sampling Samyang's hot chicken flavor ramen—a dish made famous by last year's viral "Korean Fire Noodle Challenge." Finally, the guys taste-test Ichiran's ultra-luxe ramen kit before stepping into the Japanese chain's legendary solo dining booths. Does complete isolation really enhance the noodle-slurping experience? Is it ever worth dropping $39 on a three-pack of instant ramen? Is the Fire Noodle Challenge really all it's cracked up to be? Find out the answers to these important questions—and more!—on an all new episode of Sean in the Wild.

<media:description>Calzones make for an objectively perfect meal. The only problem with the folded pocket of meat and cheese? You can't eat more of them. Enter: the panzerotto. Slightly smaller than a calzone, and made with a lighter, more airy dough, the panzerotto is built to excel in two key areas: variety and portability. Where a calzone leaves diners stuffed and table-bound, panzerotti are billed as a street food, allowing folded-pizza fans to enjoy a number of different fillings as they stroll. At Panzerotti Bites, a new home for the Puglian staple in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, proprietors Vittoria Lattanzio and Pasquale De Ruvo are striving to carve out a niche for the half-moon dish all its own. Lightly fried and stuffed with mozzarella and marinara sauce, panzerotti deserve your respect without comparison or contrast.

<media:description>Eating soup dumplings can feel like a perilous culinary adventure for the uninitiated.

But luckily Sean Tang, owner of Pinch Chinese in Manhattan, is here to school you on the soup dumpling dos and don’ts. From the cooking process behind the restaurant’s thin-skinned xiaolongbao, to different methods for enjoying the dumpling once it’s been steamed, Tang unlocks the keys to one of China’s most beloved culinary exports. Expertly folded, and packed with a rich, flavorful broth, these soup-filled pockets are a must try for dumpling fanatics everywhere.

<media:description>Trick Daddy is a platinum-selling artist with more than 20 years in the rap game, a bonafide hitmaker, and arguably hip-hop's greatest chef. But how is he with hot food? Find out as the Miami rap legend takes on the wings of death and discusses everything from partying with Jeremy Shockey, to hip-hop's enduring love affair with Benihana. As the spice builds and he sends up a prayer to make it through the challenge, Trick also opens up the influence of www.thug.com, his Miami spring-break tips, and his suspicions about self-driving cars. If you loved Hot Ones in the early days, you'll love this episode with a hip-hop O.G.

<media:description>New York City Chinese food is a genre unto itself. But how do some of the city’s most popular, Chinese-inspired dishes taste to China’s biggest hip-hop group? Straight out of Chengdu, Sichuan, 88rising’s Higher Brothers are here to help Sean Evans rate the merits and faults of items like mapo tofu chili cheese fries and General Tso’s chicken and waffles. Will these untraditional Chinese meals remind MaSiWei, DZknow, Melo, and Psy.P of the cooking back home, or feel as disappointingly inauthentic as a “Gucci Gang” remix? Find out the answers to these important questions—and more!—on an all new episode of Sean in the Wild.

<media:description>Every culture has its own unique take on barbecue. In the Philippines, the holy union of meat and fire is a meat-lovers' dream. Cooked on skewers and paired with some San Miguel beer, Filipino barbecue sets itself apart by slathering a 7-Up and banana ketchup-based barbecue sauce on slabs of pork and chicken. At Brooklyn's FOB, chef Armando Litiatco takes the fun of street food and combines it with the familiar flavors of his Filipino childhood. Sticky, tangy, and fall-off-the-bone tender, dishes like FOB's chicken inasal and grilled spare ribs are a must-try for barbecue fanatics everywhere.

<media:description>Philip DeFranco is O.G. YouTube royalty, and his eponymous show is a paradigm-shifting mix of news and opinion tackling everything from politics, to celebrity gossip, to the crypto-currency boom. But what does a decade-plus on the platform mean if he can't handle his spicy wings?! By popular demand (i.e., an insane amount of comments demanding his presence at the table), Philly D finally steps into the Hot Ones terror dome to go head to head with our bald protagonist, Sean Evans. As they fend off the Scoville onslaught, the duo gets into the weeds of YouTube history, unpackages the problems with contemporary media, and reveals photographic evidence of a bygone era when Sean actually had a six pack. And that's not all—with the weight of YouTube on his back, DeFranco boldly sets out to go where no guest has gone before. Don't miss this piece of Hot Ones history.

<media:description>Sean Evans teams up with party legend Andrew W.K. and "pizza czar" Anthony Falco for a very special mission: Is it possible to recreate Pizza Hut's most iconic menu items at home? From stuffed-crust pizza to the chain's legendary pan pie, our heroes learn how to make a couple of pizza-party classics without calling up the delivery guy. Then, as an ode to some of the chain's wild, international pizza offerings, Falco unveils a chorizo-topped taco pie with "nacho-bite" crust. Made with butter-filled dough and heaps of melted mozzarella, these throwback menu items open a portal to the pizza-party heydays of 1995. Will Andrew and Sean quit their day jobs to become fast-food pizzaiolos, or ruin their next dinner with some lack-luster cheesy crust? Watch an all new, nostalgia-packed episode of SITW and find out. And for those watching at home without a slice in hand, take comfort in the wise words of Andrew W.K.: "Every party is a pizza party, even if there isn't pizza there."

<media:description>Too often Mexican cuisine is reduced solely to tacos and burritos. The country is full of rich culinary traditions, and nowhere is that more apparent than Oaxaca. At Guelaguetza—the legendary Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles' Koreatown—Oaxacan tlayudas and mole take centerstage. Topped with meat, cheese, and salty, chicharrón-like asiento, tlayudas have a role in Oaxacan cuisine that far exceeds their reputation as "Mexican pizza." Mole—the rich, spice-and-pepper-packed sauce of the region—is used to to drench the tlayudas, as well as chicken, enchiladas, and any other foodstuff within arm's reach. Helmed by second-generation owner Bricia Lopez, Guelaguetza is a bucket-list destination for anyone looking to experience the culture of Oaxaca and L.A. at the same time.

<media:description>In the span of a few short years, Shawn Mendes has gone from learning the guitar via YouTube tutorials in his bedroom to playing sold-out arenas alongside Taylor Swift. But how is he with spicy food? Find out as the 19-year-old pop phenom reps his Canadian roots while taking on the wings of death. Along the scorched road, Mendes addresses everything from Justin Bieber's hockey skills, to guitar-store etiquette, to what he can sing about on his forthcoming album that he could never sing about before. Have we seen a bigger physical transformation from a guest in the hot seat since Martin Garrix? You be the judge.

<media:description>From Neapolitan and Sicilian to Detroit-style and deep dish, NYC is a wonderland for regional pizza styles. Now, a cheesy, soufflé-like pie from Milan is set to take the five boroughs by storm. Enter: The Big Ragu, the latest slice shop from cousins Francis Garcia and Sal Basille of Artichoke Pizza fame. Using a special, rotating oven, the Big Ragu creates a pie that's crisp on the bottom and perfectly doughy through the center. Serving slices cut into cubes—and enjoyed with a controversial fork—these Staten Island natives are challenging the ways New Yorkers see pizza. Love it or hate it, just remember one thing: At the Big Ragu, the sauce is the boss.

<media:description>Rugelach is one of the world's most recognizable Jewish pastries. But in NYC, some of the best rugelach is made uptown at Lee Lee's Baked Goods in Harlem. Tucked away on 118th Street, Lee Lee's proudly offers customers "Rugelach by a Brother"—a tagline concocted by 75-year-old owner Alvin Lee Smalls. With each soft, flakey bite crafted entirely by hand, Smalls considers himself the last of a dying breed: a true pastry master keeping New York's old-school recipes and baking techniques alive.

<media:description>Millions of us have fallen in love with Bob's Burgers, the heartwarming cartoon series that chronicles the life of Bob Belcher and his family-run burger joint. For chefs like Alvin Cailan, many parts of Bob's life resonate with his own experience running a kitchen. Which is why Alvin was so excited to meet the man who voices Bob—H. Jon Benjamin—and cook burgers from the show IRL for the season finale of The Burger Show. If you want to taste burgers made on The Burger Show, check out the last night of Alvin's burger pop-up, March 13th, at the Nolitan Hotel in NYC.

First We Feast's "The Burger Show" is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, burger scholar George Motz, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.

<media:description>Prior to opening Lucali in 2006, Mark Iacono had never dreamt of being a cook. Today, he operates one of the best pizzerias not only in New York City, but the entire world. In a rare, intimate glimpse at Iacono's life, this Food Skills mini-doc charts the chef's unlikely rise from Brooklyn construction worker to internationally renowned pizzaiolo. While walking the streets of his native Carroll Gardens, Iacono reminisces about a rapidly changing neighborhood, and unlocks the keys to his world-famous margherita pie. From studying at the altar of Di Fara’s Dom DeMarco, to serving A-list celebrities like Jay Z and Beyoncé, the story of Lucali is made of pizza lore and legend.

<media:description>In Northern New Jersey, sliders reign supreme. The tiny, 1oz patties smashed thin on a griddle, smothered with onions, and placed between steamed buns are a regional speciality that have been perfected at the Jersey City landmark, White Mana. The history alone is worth the trip, which is why host Alvin Cailan invited Top Chef judge/host and fellow burger burger fanatic, Padma Lakshmi, to soak up some Jersey lore. Get to know the diner's ties to 1939 World's Fair, as well as its surprising connection to heavyweight champ Mike Tyson, from longtime owner Mario Costa. This is a piece of burger mythology you don't want to miss.

<media:description>David Chang's new Netflix docu-series, Ugly Delicious, just launched February 23. Here, the Momofuku mastermind breaks down the guiding principles behind his "ugly delicious" philosophy—an ideology that pushes diners to see the hidden beauty in everyday food. At his new L.A. outpost, Majordōmo, Chang whips up Asia's ubiquitous bing bread, a pancake-like dish that changes meaning depending on the region and culture. Paired with chickpea Hozon—Momofuku's own fermented chemistry experiment—the bread is a simple meal with complex underpinnings. Both Ugly Delicious and bing bread are perfect for diners eager to look beyond the plate.

<media:description>When it comes to food on the Internet, the bigger and bolder—and more rainbow colors—the better. It's a formula that's spawned a wave of "Stunt Food"—food whose sole purpose is to rack up likes on your Instagram feed. Chefs may not crave this kind of food, but it's no secret that they're also natural competitors. When they see something on their social feed, their first instinct is to say "I can do it better." So in the spirit of duking it out in the kitchen, Alvin goes head-to-head with Top Chef alum Ilan Hall to see who has the chops to make the craziest, most gonzo Stunt Burger. And they've got an all-star panel of judges—Sean Evans, Matty Matheson, Miss Info—to see if they've gone too far.

<media:description>In the world of burgers, the In-N-Out vs. Shake Shack rivalry is the stuff of legend, pitting east coast against west coast in a battle of patty supremacy. But rather than feed the fire of an old flame, Alvin Cailan is teaming up with YouTube legend Andrew Rea (Binging With Babish) to teach people how to make both of these iconic burgers at home. Better yet, they've devised the ultimate peace treaty: a Double Shack x Double-Double Animal-style Voltron burger. It's a moment in burger history you won't want to miss.

<media:description>A semi-finalist for Best Chef at the 2018 James Beard Awards, Charles Gabriel breaks down the keys to his now legendary pan-fried chicken recipe. Often neglected for a deep-fryer and a vat of oil, the giant pan makes for a crispier, juicier final product, and requires non-stop focus from the chef. At Charles’ Country Pan Fried Chicken, whole birds are butchered, battered, and then flipped one-by-one in the pan until golden brown. A staple in Harlem, New York, and a boon to home cooks everywhere, the pan-fried style perfected by Gabriel will change the way you look at fried chicken.

<media:description>For the momentous 100th episode of Hot Ones, we had to track down one of the most requested, most elusive guests on our wish list: the hilarious Hannibal Buress. While struggling through the wings of death, the comedian pulls back the curtain on the Eric Andre show, discusses his off-piste rap career, and explains the art of wearing a jumpsuit with your face on it. He also tries out some unconventional techniques to tame the heat, including "weird vitamins" and a pre-show cryotherapy session. Thanks for rocking with us through 100 episodes, Hot Ones fans! Here's to many more hot questions, and even more hotter wings...

<media:description>In the second episode of The Burger Show, host Alvin Cailan teams up with burger scholar George Motz to learn about the diversity of burgers across the U.S. Just like barbecue, the burger has absorbed local traditions—in places like Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Connecticut—that reflect a unique sense of regional pride. From the glory of deep-fried patties, to the mechanical wizardry of steamed cheeseburgs, Alvin receives a master class in regional burger styles.

<media:description>In Japanese cuisine, the concept of "omakase" leaves the choices entirely up to the chef. At Shuko, one of the premiere sushi restaurants in NYC, the menu is driven by the imaginations of Nick Kim and Jimmy Lau, as well as the whims of Mother Nature. Hyper-fresh cuts of bluefin tuna, squid, barracuda, and needlefish travel from the chefs' hands directly to the diners' plates. The result is a meal that flows seamlessly from one course to the next. One of Manhattan's most traditional omakase experiences, as well as one of its most boundary-pushing, Shuko is a bucket-list destination for sushi obsessives worldwide.

<media:description>Chicken, pork, or steak—the Big Three of taco fillings have their place, but true Mexican food-enthusiasts know when to switch things up. Enter: The fish taco. Deep-fried or pan-seared, the dish offers a pescatarian respite from mundane Tex-Mex menus. At Tacombi's new outpost in the Empire State Building, chef Oscar Hernandez offers two regional takes on the dish: a crispy, Baja-style cod, and a spicy, "tikin xic" rock fish grilled on the flat-top. No matter how they're prepared, fish tacos should be on every Mexican food-lover's bucket list.

<media:description>First We Feast's "The Burger Show" is a new web series premiering Feb. 6th that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of tricked-out, gourmet burgers, to the pride of regional burgers—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, Padma Lakshmi, Matty Matheson, and Binging With Babish to help him along the way.

<media:description>Meat, cheese, and two slices of bread. It's a trinity that's satisfied appetites all over the world. But Mexico's take on the every-man staple deserves a place in the sandwich hall of fame. Defined by its chewy, baguette-like bread, the torta turns Mexican meats like lamb barbacoa into handheld snacks. At Brooklyn’s La Loncheria, the sandwich gets an international spin, where chef Luis Jiménez meshes the torta with elements of the Vietnamese banh mi. No matter the style, the torta is a bucket-list item for sandwich-lovers from Mexico City to NYC.

<media:description>Hi everybody! On the season finale of Sean in the Wild, Sean Evans teams up with YouTube cooking legend Maangchi for a crash-course in one of the world's most celebrated chicken dishes. That's right, Sean and Maangchi are joining forces to batter, sauce, and double-fry their own batch of spicy Korean fried chicken. From Maangchi's past life as an online gamer, to KFC's humble beginnings in 1980s Korea, Sean and Maangchi bond over plates of gochujang-covered drums and flats.

<media:description>Japan is hallowed ground for food obsessives the world over. But there's one style of Japanese cooking that turns traditional cuisine into high art. Inspired by the changing of the seasons and the beauty of nature, Kaiseki is the country's unique version of haute cuisine. At Brushstroke, chef Isao Yamada uses an ever-changing array of seasonal ingredients to tell stories from life in Japan. From slices of sashimi to charcoal-roasted eel, Brushtroke's kaiseki menu features food as metaphor and allegory.

<media:description>Hot Ones is back, and it's hotter than ever. In the Season 5 premiere, actress Taraji P. Henson—whose roles include bad-b*tch extraordinaire Cookie Lyon on Empire—becomes the first brave celebrity to battle the all-new wings of death. But not everything goes according to plan: After breaking down her Mary J. Blige–approved chili recipe and explaining what Cookie would make of Cardi B, Taraji pulls one of the most unorthodox moves in Hot Ones history, calling in some extra muscle—and a little whiskey—to tame the rising flames.

<media:description>Sean Evans has spent nearly 100 episodes choking down hot sauce. But does he have what it takes to make his own concoction? Anxious to turn the tables, Sean teams up with Hot Ones legend Erica Diehl—better known as Queen Majesty—for a crash-course in the hot sauce-making commandments. From a mild pineapple and jalapeño sauce to a fiery "Sicilian" scorpion blend, Sean learns how to slice, chop, and churn his way to new hot-sauce heights. 

A special thank you to Homesweet Homegrown for supplying the scorpion peppers. The pineapple and jalapeño recipe will appear in a forthcoming cookbook from High River Sauce's Steve Seabury.

<media:description>Everyone has their own method when it comes to eating hot pot. But there are some strategies for getting the most out of your meat and broth. From cooking times to sauce pairings, Tang Hot Pot's Yu Li is here to break down the simmered-soup dos and don'ts. A newcomer to NYC's Chinatown, Tang specializes in the ultra-spicy, chili-filled hot pot native to Chengdu, Sichuan. Stocked with items like swamp eel, chicken gizzard, and beef tripe, the restaurant's menu appeals to those in search of a true Sichuan experience.

<media:description>Egg sandwiches are available at every bodega, cornerstone, and fast-food joint. But at Eggslut, chef Alvin Cailan is turning the everyday breakfast sandwich into a work of art. A cult favorite in L.A., and now available at Chefs Club Counter in NYC, Eggslut’s secret is patience. Eggs and butter are added to a cold pan, and gently stirred on low heat. The result is something soft, smooth, and covered in melted cheese and sriracha mayo. Eggslut’s Fairfax is a must-try for any egg-sandwich enthusiast.

<media:description>As an international pop star, Kris Wu has eaten renditions of dishes from his native China the world over. Eager to learn more about regional Chinese cuisine, Sean Evans takes Kris to Mr. Bing, a new home for Beijing-style street food in NYC. From the pancake-like jianbings, to bowls of beef packed with Sichuan peppercorns, Kris gives Sean a crash-course in four distinct styles of Chinese cooking. Will Kris and Sean learn how to successfully make a bing, or botch the restaurant’s Seamless orders? Find out on an all new episode of SITW.

<media:description>New York bagels are a thing of legend, but how exactly does the city boil and bake its dough? At Murray's Bagels in Greenwich Village, the ingredients haven't strayed too far from the original, century-old recipe: All you need is flour, salt, yeast, barley malt, and, of course, NYC tap water. Owned by Adam Pomerantz (who also owns Leo's Bagels in the Financial District), Murray's prides itself on churning out perfectly chewy bagels with an even, golden-brown crust. The result is something well-suited to a schmear of cream cheese, a slice of lox, or a slab of bacon and eggs.

<media:description>Sean Evans and Chili Klaus have joined forces to eat the world's hottest pepper, the Carolina Reaper, not once but twice in their storied history. So you knew that when the Danish thrill-seeker finally stepped into the Hot Ones terror-dome, we couldn't serve him the normal wings of death. Instead, we teamed up with our chili guru Noah Chaimberg to lace the poultry with pure, unadulterated pepper mash from some of the hottest chilies in the world, including the Chocolate Bhutlah (2 million Scoville) and Caramel Reaper. Will the insane duo survive a dab of "Reaper Blood," or will this be the end of the road for Sean and Klaus? Find out in this explosive end-of-year Hot Ones special.

<media:description>NYC is a dumpling-lover's paradise, with versions from all around the world available at all times of day. But in a pocket of the East Village known as Little Ukraine, the pierogi is the clear leader in the savory, meat-stuffed dough category. Also packed with cheese, cabbage, and potato, Veselka's plump and savory potstickers harken back to grandma's cooking from the old county. Dipping the dumplings in apple sauce is optional, but remember: At Veselka, onions and sour cream are always required.

<media:description>Calzones are a staple of the pizza-parlor menu, but too often the dish doesn't get the respect it deserves. That's too bad, because the calzone is a near-perfect food: According to Mathieu Palombino—the owner of Motorino Pizzeria in NYC—these wood-fired pizza pockets allow ingredients to stay ultra-moist and flavorful while cooking inside the oven. Stuffed with a mixture of sweet and spicy sausage, and held together by globs of melted Pecorino Romano cheese, Motorino's calzone is a worthy alternative to a classic pie.

<media:description>Once mocked for its lack of quality smoked meats, NYC has finally become a serious contender on the national BBQ scene. But does it have the chops to appease two Texas locals? In the hopes of gaining some perspective, Sean Evans enlists the help of Barbara Dunkelman and Burnie Burns—two of the visionaries behind Austin-based production company Rooster Teeth. At Fletcher’s in Brooklyn, chef Matt Fisher is busy combining Southern cooking techniques with international flavors, creating a barbecue style that’s distinctly New York. Will the pork char siu be enough to convert Barbara and Burnie to the church of NYC BBQ? Watch an all new episode of SITW and find out.

<media:description>NYC is already a noodle-lover's paradise. But there's a new dish closing in on the city's ramen and soba shops: Chinese mixian. Made from fermented rice noodles, and found in China's Yunnan Province, mixian can be seen as a light, fragrant relative to pho. At Little Tong Noodle Shop, chef Simone Tong pairs her mixian with home-style chicken broth, fermented chiles, and Chinese tea eggs. Covered with edible flowers, and topped with items like chicken confit and minced pork, mixian is as beautiful as it is hearty.

<media:description>Eating with Jo Koy is a lot like seeing his stand-up routine: loud, in your face, and filled with stories about his eccentric Filipino family. When it came time for Sean Evans to dive head first into the menu at Jeepney Filipino Gastropub in NYC, the choice for a dinner companion was a no-brainer. From staples like chicken adobo and arroz caldo, to now-legendary dishes like halo-halo and balut, Jo breaks down the Filipino food dos and don’ts as only he could. Will Sean convince Jo to give balut another shot, or will he swear off bird embryos for ever? Find out on an all new SITW.

<media:description>Covered in chile sauce, and stuffed with meats like chicken or pork, enchiladas are one of Mexico's most beloved culinary exports. At El Atoradero, chef Denisse Lina Chavez drenches her enchiladas in the rich, spice-packed mole found in the city of Puebla. Though taquerias have become ubiquitous in NYC, Chavez prides herself on bringing "traditional" Mexican cuisine to the five boroughs, following recipes passed down from her grandmother. With fresh tortillas sopped in dark-red mole poblano, El Atoradero's enchiladas are a bucket-list item for Mexican-food fanatics everywhere.

<media:description>Alexa Chung is one of the Hot Ones muses. Back in the U.K., she hosted Channel 4's PopWorld, where she knocked music's biggest stars out of their PR-driven flight pattern with her hilarious segments and tongue-in-cheek questions. From there she hopped the pond to host her own MTV show, and has since become one of the fashion world's power players, launching her own clothing line, hosting a web series for Vogue, and generally killing it on both sides of the Atlantic. But how is she with hot food? Find out she takes on the wings of death in a Molly Goddard dress, explaining how she got banned from red-carpet hosting duties while entering a spice prison built out of capsaicin-laced vegan nuggets.

<media:description>Rich Chigga may be a rap star, meme legend, and fanny-pack icon. But he also boasts a wealth of knowledge about Indonesian food. Hoping to get a grasp on the country's cuisine, Sean Evans brings the Jakarta native to Bali Kitchen—a new destination for fast-casual Indonesian food in NYC. From rendang and nasi goreng, to the various spice levels found in sambal, Rich Chigga breaks down the Indonesian food commandments once and for all. But whatever you do, just don't call him a hot dog.

<media:description>Japanese ramen bars are all over NYC. But there's another noodle style that's poised to take the city by storm: Korean ramyun. Inspired by the cult status of Korean instant noodles, chef Douglas Kim set out to create a bowl of ramen that captures the culture of the country. At Jeju Noodle Bar in Manhattan, diners are greeted with chewy, slurp-able noodles; thick, pork-based soup; and an assortment of Korean-inspired toppings like kimchi and gochujang. Jeju's ramyun offers a chef-driven spin on your favorite freeze-dried noodle packs.

<media:description>Peking duck has long been a staple in NYC. But at Decoy, chef Joe Ng is taking the classic Chinese dish to new heights. Known for its crispy, golden skin and tender meat, Peking duck is typically topped with hoisin and wrapped in thin pancakes. At Decoy, chef Ng has added toppings like sesame-peanut sauce, cranberry, and pico de gallo into the mix, putting a multi-cultural spin on more traditional Chinese fare. Decoy's duck-centric menu is perfect for Chinese-food fans looking to broaden their horizons.

<media:description>As the host of Viceland's "The Pizza Show," Frank Pinello eats, breaths, and sleeps slices. But what you might not know about Frank is that he's also one of NYC's biggest Japanese food obsessives. On a rare day off from pizza and chicken wings, Sean Evans decides to take his friend on a tour of Manhattan's Little Tokyo—a stretch of the East Village that's home to some of the city's most sought-after Japanese cuisine. With the help of TIC restaurant group's Sakura Yagi, Sean and Frank slurp soba, binge on Japanese street food, and slice open some omurice.

<media:description>Tender, juicy, and lightly blackened, tandoori chicken is the platonic ideal poultry. To make the dish, chunks of chicken are skewered, marinated, and then lowered into a tandoor oven—a cylindrical kiln heated by charcoal. At NYC's Badshah—a modern Indian restaurant helmed by chef Charles Mani—tandoori chicken is all about letting the meat's natural flavors shine through. For BBQ-chicken obsessives, tandoori cooking is a no-brainer.

<media:description>Sizzling meat is a hallmark of every Korean barbecue menu. But at Cote Korean Steakhouse in NYC, the restaurant takes your classic cuts of galbi and bulgogi and kicks them up a notch, dry-aging its beef for up to 120 days in a state of the art meat locker. Cooked on $4,000 Japanese grills—and paired with ultra-luxe side dishes like kimchi-wagyu paella—Cote puts an international flare on the classic Manhattan chophouse. This dry-aged Korean barbecue deserves a place on every meat-lover's bucket-list.

<media:description>One of the most common questions in the Hot Ones mailbag is, "What hot sauce should I put on my lunch!?" Since Sean Evans can't reply to every photo of pizza and steak sent his way, he hooked up with the Hot Ones chili guru Noah Chaimberg of Heatonist to provide a masterclass that you can apply to ALL your meals. Time to get out of your Sriracha holding pattern and crank up the heat!

<media:description>Eating ice cream can often feel like a transformative experience. But for Michael Cole—the owner of Mikey Likes It Ice Cream in NYC—the frozen treat took him from a six-month prison stint to being a true role model in his community. Like all great success stories, Cole's boils down to the basics: fresh ingredients, a positive outlook, and rich, velvety ice cream blended in-house. With menu items like "2 Live Crew" and "The Humpty Dance," Mikey Likes It is perfect for any dessert-lover who enjoys their ice cream with a side of hip-hop.

<media:description>Few foodstuffs are more quintessential to the New York experience than cheesecake. And few restaurants have mastered the art of the dessert quite like Junior's, the 67-year-old diner located in Downtown Brooklyn. Under third generation owner Alan Rosen, Junior's has grown from a family-run business into a bonafide cheesecake empire. But at the corner of Flatbush Avenue and DeKalb Avenue, the original Junior's recipe hasn't changed an ounce. Packed with dense, creamy filling, and encased in a thick, crumbly crust, Junior's cheesecake is still a bucket-list item for any New Yorker with a sweet tooth.

<media:description>In New York City, Neapolitan-style pizza gets a lot of shine. But there's another thin-crust pie from Italy that's worthy of a place in your pizza rotation. At Martina, Roman-style pizza is the main event—a dish defined by its thin, cracker-like crust, sparse layer of sauce, and evenly proportioned toppings. Left in the oven for an extra 30 seconds—an eternity in the eyes of a pizzaiolo—the pie develops a crispy exterior and perfectly charred underside. When at Martina, eat as the Romans do.

<media:description>Does it ever make sense to drop $162 on a hunk of beef? Steven Lim and Andrew Ilnyckyj—the hosts of BuzzFeed's hugely popular series, "Worth It"—help Sean Evans answer this age-old, New York steakhouse conundrum. Joined by Bowery Meat Company's Josh Capon (and of course cameraman Adam Bianchi...), the guys chew their way through a $148 T-bone Florentine, a $125 chateaubriand, and a $162 tomahawk ribeye. Find out which cut of meat is really worth maxing out that credit card on an all new episode of Sean in the Wild.

<media:description>Digging into a crab can be an intimidating task for some. Armed with picks, mallets, and crackers, crab fanatics pride themselves on the ability to extract every last morsel of meat from the legs and claws. Luckily, Fifi Clanton and Gwendolyn Woods—the dynamic duo behind Brooklyn's the Crabby Shack—are here to breakdown the crustacean cracking commandments for beginners. From the soft meat hidden inside the body, to the proper way to crack a claw, Clanton and Woods leave no shell unturned.

So what better place to unpackage it all than a black room inhabited only by a bald man and some dangerously hot chicken wings? Welcome to Hot Ones with Joji, people.

<media:description>The phrase "deep-fried pizza" might conjure up images of clogged arteries and Texas state fairs. But at Don Antonio—one of Manhattan's most authentic pizzerias—chef Roberto Caporuscio is slowly converting the masses to a Neapolitan classic. Using tomatoes from San Marzano and smoked buffalo mozzarella from Capua, the restaurant's signature montanara pizza is a fried dish rooted in freshness. Thanks to a Neapolitan oven powered by volcanic stone, the fried dough quickly cooks off its oil and grease, leaving a flaky crust and perfectly layered pie.

Rubbing his pork shoulder in a chile-packed adobo, and folding it an endless supply of fresh tortillas, Stupak marries the melting pot of Mexico City to the grit of the East Village at one of Empellón's most beloved outposts in NYC.

At the Moranos' Staten Island home, Sean learns how to toss dough and slice mutz before getting his hands on the family's age-old marinara recipe. Will Sean's pie impress Dom's mom, or will he get smacked for suggesting they use jarred sauce? Find out on an all-new episode of SITW.

<media:description>Slurping noodles from a steaming bowl is great, but it's not the only way to enjoy your ramen. In Tokyo, a deconstructed style of the dish called tsukemen has become increasingly popular among Japanese ramaniancs. Renowned noodle master Ivan Orkin of Ivan Ramen is one of a handful of ramen chefs who have started to introduce New Yorkers to the gospel of tsukemen, in which cold noodles are dipped into a bowl of extra-potent broth to soak up flavor. Tsukemen is perfect for ramen obsessives who see noodles as the main event.

<media:description>Former Das Racist rapper Himanshu Suri—better known as Heems—is here to school Sean Evans on the ins and outs of Indian cooking. From the massive, wall-to-wall spice aisle at an Indian market, to the stacks of ramen-like masala munchies and Parle-G biscuits, Heems breaks down the dos and dont's for desi grocery shopping. Back at the Suris' Long Island home, Heems and his mother cook Sean butter chicken, okra, and naan bread, adding some Sriracha and Halal Guys-style white sauce for a taste of both New York and South Asia.

<media:description>Though yakitori is often labeled as Japanese bar food, grilling the perfect chicken skewer takes a master's touch. At Torishin, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Hell's Kitchen, head chef Atsushi Kono is elevating the beloved street snack to new heights, earning a three-star review from The New York Times in the process. Delicately seasoned with salt and tare sauce, yakitori utilizes every part of the chicken in order to stimulate the senses. One of Torishin's savory, char-grilled skewers is enough to turn any fine-dining fan into a Japanese food obsessive.

<media:description>When one thinks of hubs for great, wood-fire pizza—from Naples, Italy to Brooklyn, New York—St. Louis, Missouri isn't always the first city that comes to mind. But nestled along the Mississippi River, the Gateway City has quietly invented one of the most distinct pizza styles in America, using a smokey Provel cheese to set itself apart from the pack. Justin Bazdarich of Speedy Romeo has made it his mission to bring the gospel of St. Louis-style pizza to NYC, forcing even the most ardent East Coast pizza snobs to rethink their loyalties in the process.

<media:description>Vince Staples has been requesting bottles of Hot Ones Fiery Chipotle for months, so it's only right that he finally stepped into the terrordome to battle the wings of death. Not only did Vince bring his own ranch (respect), but the young rap phenom—whose excellent sophomore album, "Big Fish Theory," is in stores now—also came through with some scorching-hot takes on everything from Chipotle, to the best gamers in hip-hop.

<media:description>The midnight munchies are a difficult meal for home cooks to master. Armed with an empty fridge and some old Cup Noodles, late-night gourmands aim to turn leftover table scraps into stoner-approved delicacies. Luckily, Mike and Josh Greenfield—otherwise known as Brothers Green Eats—are here to help Sean Evans take his munchie-making game to the next level. Using just five ingredients for every recipe, these culinary MacGyvers teach Sean how to upgrade dishes like French toast, instant ramen, and flatbread pizza, without burning his apartment down. Turn to these easy-to-make stoner snacks the next time you're too broke to order 4 a.m. takeout.

<media:description>Eating lobster is not for the faint of heart. One of the few meals messy enough to require its own bib, a lobster dinner can often end in spilled butter, mounting frustration, and heaps of discarded shells. Luckily, executive chef Dave Seigal of the Lobster Place in Chelsea Market is here to breakdown the crustacean cracking does and don'ts. From how to properly pry open a claw, to that little nugget of meat hiding just behind the head, chef Seigal explains how to sink your lobster pick into every last morsel.

<media:description>Throughout Hot Ones history, no one has gone out in a blaze of glory quite like Eddie Huang. After attempting to take on the wings of death in reverse order, the IBS-afflicted chef had a near-fatal meltdown at First We Feast headquarters. But today, the Baohaus boss is back for revenge, challenging host Sean Evans to the fight of the century at Overthrow Boxing in NYC. The opponents ultimately bury the hatchet over some next-level Mongolian hot pot. But first, it's a boxing match that makes McGregor vs. Mayweather feel like child's play. Who will win the title—the Human Panda, or the Chicken Wing Champ? Watch a special, action-packed episode of Sean in the Wild and find out!

<media:description>In the U.S., the word "ramen" conjures up images of chewy yellow noodles and bubbling vats of tonkotsu-style broth. But lately, a different style of noodle-making has been capturing the imaginations of ramaniacs everywhere. Enter: mazemen. Fresh off a cameo on Aziz Ansari's Master of None, Yuji Haraguchi's mazemen is a broth-less ramen topped with bacon, egg, and bonito flakes. Customers are tasked with mixing the ingredients together, and the result is a heap of gooey, yolk-and-pork covered noodles, sans soup. Mazemen is the perfect bowl for ramen-lovers who crave noodles—and little else.

<media:description>"What if you turned a chicken wing into a doughnut?" These are the type of hot questions that get us fired up around First We Feast HQ, so when The Doughnut Project in NYC came to us with the crazy idea of creating a pastry with Hot Ones Fiery Chipotle, we were intrigued. The delicious result of their mad-scientist experimentation features hot sauce-infused frosting, crispy chicken skin, and blue-cheese crumble. Watch Sean Evans get his first taste-test of the doughnut, then get your hands on it yourself: The Hot Ones Doughnut will be on sale for one day only—National Chicken Wing Day—this Saturday, 29.

<media:description>Shake Shack is getting into spicy-chicken game with its brand-new Hot Chick’n sandwich—a crispy chicken breast dusted with a guajillo and cayenne pepper blend, then tucked into a Martin's potato bun with herb buttermilk slaw. Who better to give it a test-drive than Sean Evans, a man who knows a thing or two about spicy chicken? Sean met up with Shake Shack culinary director Mark Rosati to get a sneak preview of the sandwich before it goes on sale nationally August 1 (or July 28 via the Shake Shack app), as well as some tips on how to make your own Nashville-style hot chicken sandwiches at home. BONUS: He also managed to coax some secret Shake Shack menu hacks out of Mark—get ready for peanut-butter bacon burgers and off-menu BLTs.

<media:description>When it comes to chicken wings, the old adage "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" often holds true. But at International Wings Factory, chef Deepak Ballaney is pushing chicken wings past the standard of Buffalo sauce and blue cheese. Located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the shop serves more than a dozen sauces, rubs, and dips with its poultry, offering customers a culinary trip around the world in the process. From flavors like black pepper teriyaki and Vietnamese chile mango, to a secret, Scoville-packed "Cry" sauce, IWF's wings should be on every chicken-lover's bucket list.

<media:description>Though dim sum has its roots in ancient China, the meal has become an inextricable part of life in NYC. In order to help Sean Evans navigate the cuisine's unique customs and courtesies, Strictly Dumpling's Mike Chen decided to set up a crash-course at Nom Wah Tea Parlor, the oldest dim sum shop in Chinatown. From proper tea etiquette to strategy for attacking a plate of chicken feet, YouTube's globetrotting gourmand breaks down the dim sum dos and dont's for dumpling fanatics everywhere.

<media:description>New Yorkers are fiercely protective of their thin-crust pizza. But on the border of Greenwich Village and Soho, one man has been brave enough to open up shop in enemy territory, finally bringing real, Chicago-style deep dish to the five boroughs. Enter: Emmett Burke. As the owner of Emmett's on Macdougal Street, Burke has worked to convert the most ardent, thin-crust pizza snobs to the gospel of deep dish. Loaded with mozzarella cheese, sausage, and vine-ripened tomatoes, a good Chicago-style pie can taste like a Neapolitan slice on steroids. If NYC truly is a cultural melting pot, why can't two superior pizza styles co-exist?

<media:description>Hot Ones Season 3 is in the rearview mirror, and Hot Ones Season 4 is coming at you like a spicy freight train next Thursday, July 20. Before the premiere, Sean Evans unveils the brand-new hot sauce lineup (spoiler alert: it's getting HOTTER), and we take an emotional look back at the highlights of season 3—from DJ Snake's moment of humanity, to the ballad of Brett Baker. As always, thank you to the fans—without you, there is no Hot Ones!

<media:description>Welcome to Food Grails, First We Feast's traveling food and culture series hosted by Miss Info. As a music journalist, she's traveled the world and seen the power of artists who rep for their hometown sound. Now, she wants to discover how foods define a city’s flavor—from D.C.'s mumbo sauce to NYC's beef patties. These are America’s food grails.

For the Food Grails season finale, Miss Info heads to Atlanta, a city that takes pride in its strip clubs, hip-hop, and wing culture. But talk to locals and you'll quickly learn that one wing stands above the rest—lemon pepper. Natives have fiercely claimed lemon pepper as their own, turning it into an icon that's been referenced in rap lyrics, television, and pop-culture. To find out why so many people have fallen under its spell, we head to strip clubs like Magic City, taste-test wings in backyard parties with Rembert Browne, and talk to some of lemon pepper's biggest supporters, Waka Flocka, Rick Ross, and Donald Glover.

<media:description>There's no worse feeling than biting into a slice of New York pizza, only to find soggy bread, congealed sauce, and a thin layer of dried-out cheese. Though it rarely gets enough shine, the enigmatic "upside-down" Sicilian has an answer to these common pizza problems, topping its melted mozzarella with ladles of steaming tomato sauce. Scarr Pimental—the owner of Scarr's Pizza on the Lower East Side—is bringing the city's upside-down Sicilian to the masses, building on a style made famous by NYC pizza masters like L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Crisp, fresh, and packed with flavor, upside-down pizza proves there's no such thing as "too much sauce" when it comes to the perfect slice.

<media:description>As restaurants continue to trend towards refinement and restraint, NYC's the Cannibal specializes in abundance. The Kips Bay mainstay is famous for offering one of the most meat-centric menus in the five boroughs, and the restaurant's crown jewel is a 36-ounce, dry-aged ribeye that's been doused in melted butter on a hot pan. Between tender cuts of steak and a decadent, cheese-and-meat-filled charcuterie board, the Cannibal is a bucket list destination for any beef-loving carnivore.

<media:description>On the very special, Season 3 finale of Hot Ones, comedian Seth Rogen and actor Dominic Cooper brace themselves for some hot questions and even hotter wings with Sean Evans. Rogen (“Preacher” creator) and Cooper (Jesse Custer) are used to battling supernatural forces for our entertainment. But how will the team fair against demonically spicy hot sauces like Mad Dog 357 and Zombie Apocalypse? From stories about near-death experiences, to thinking up a new, NSFW hot sauce name, Rogen and Cooper bring the heat on the most combustible season send-off to date. Preacher airs on AMC on Mondays at 9/8c

<media:description>The term "barbecue" means something different depending on where you are and who you ask. From Texas and Tennessee, to North Carolina and Alabama, every region has its own way of doing things. Like all red-blooded Americans, Sean Evans loves his pulled pork, baby back ribs, and brisket. But as a New Yorker, he can't always pack up his bags and head down south for dinner. Luckily, the Big Apple Barbecue Block Party brings some of the nation's best pitmasters to NYC every year. Will Sean fall in love with Shane Griffith's burnt ends, or hold out for Chris Lilly's award-winning pulled pork? Watch this meat-tastic episode of SITW and find out.

<media:description>When it comes to Japanese hot pot, there are two distinct schools of thought: sukiyaki is a sweet, slow-simmered love affair, while shabu-shabu features savory slices of beef cooked rapidly in boiling water. Shabu-Tatsu on E. 10th Street is one of the only spots in NYC where Japanese food fanatics can get their hands on both dishes. Most importantly, the restaurant serves paper-thin cuts of prime rib and marbled wagyu, making Shabu-Tatsu the perfect destination for sizzling meat dunked in umami-packed dipping sauces.

<media:description>Welcome to Food Grails, First We Feast's traveling food and culture series hosted by Miss Info. As a music journalist, she's traveled the world and seen the power of artists who rep for their hometown sound. Now, she wants to discover how foods define a city’s flavor—from D.C.'s mumbo sauce to NYC's beef patties. These are America’s food grails.

For episode 4, we head to New Orleans. Forty years ago, Vietnamese migration to NOLA introduced bánh mì to po' boy country. Now, the lines between two iconic sandwiches are blurring. To find out what happens when you mash up the Mississippi Delta and the Mekong Delta, we spoke to New Orleans legend Curren$y, Times-Picayune writer Brett Anderson, and Banh Mi Boys chef Peter Nguyen.

<media:description>Over the years, Anthony Fantano has reviewed thousands of albums on his wildly popular YouTube channel, the Needle Drop. But today, two of the Internet's busiest bald men are joining forces like Voltron to answer the one question that really matters: Are vegan meat substitutes actually any good? Anthony, a self-professed "thicc vegan," and Sean Evans, a professional chicken wing-eater, are coming at this from two different perspectives. Will the BBQ seitan sandwich from Monk's Meats appeal to Sean's carnivorous pallet? Will the infamous Impossible Burger drive Anthony to the brink of insanity? Watch the latest episode of SITW and find out.

Y'all know this is just their opinion, right?

Here's the lineup: 

BBQ Seitan Sandwich - Monk's Meats
Spicy Merguez Sandwich - The Butcher's Daughter
The New Creation - Superiority Burger
The Impossible Burger - Bareburger

<media:description>In Manhattan, chef Wylie Dufresne is practically synonymous with fine dining. As the owner of critically-acclaimed restaurants like wd~50 and Alder, Dufresne brought the concept of molecular gastronomy—a movement that blends science and food—to New York City. For his latest project, Dufresne has chosen to scale things back: instead opening an old-fashioned doughnut shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Still, at Du's Donuts and Coffee, there's a meticulous attention to detail that extends past your typical fried pastry joint. With flavors like strawberries and cream, pomegranate sesame, and peanut butter yuzu, Dufresne's latest venture is a doughnut-lovers playground.

<media:description>Few institutions are more synonymous with life in NYC than the local neighborhood bodega. From snacks and sandwiches to blunt wraps and laundry detergent, chances are the store on your block has it all. As a Chicago native, Sean Evans is a relative newcomer to the Vienna sausage-stacked aisles of the bodega. In the hopes of understanding NYC's most enigmatic marketplace, Sean enlisted the help of Wiki and Your Old Droog: two of the city's fastest-rising MCs. Together, Wiki and Droog breakdown the bodega dos and don'ts, examine the store's influence on New York hip-hop, and go on a luxurious $10 shopping spree. Who can make a dollar stretch the farthest on the Lower East Side? Watch the latest episode of SITW and find out.

<media:description>Growing up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, The Pizza Show's Frank Pinello often had to choose between three classic slices: the Sicilian-style square, the regular NYC slice, and the enigmatic white pizza. As an adult, the white pie has captured Pinello's imagination and become a favorite among his customers at Best Pizza in Williamsburg. Topped with ricotta, mozzarella, caramelized onions, and parsley, the dish pushes NYC pizza past the old standard of red sauce and orange grease. Packed with flavor and perennially underrated, Best Pizza's white pie deserves to be on every slice lover's bucket list.

<media:description>Welcome to Food Grails, First We Feast traveling food and culture series hosted by Miss Info. As a music journalist, she's travelled the world and seen the power of artists who rep for their hometown sound. Now, she wants to discover how foods define a city’s flavor—from Atlanta's lemon-pepper wings, to NYC's beef patties. These are America’s food grails.

In episode 3, Miss Info heads to Washington D.C. to find out about the city's regional specialty, mumbo sauce. Whether you like yours dark-red or orange, tangy or peppery, mumbo is at the core of D.C.'s subculture. But as the city undergoes gentrification, will mumbo sauce retain its vitality? We spoke to Wale, Shy Glizzy, Kokayi, and Tony Lewis Jr. to find out what the future holds for the city's special sauce.

<media:description>Kobe beef produces some of the most coveted steaks on the planet. And while hundreds of sports bars offer bargain-priced "Kobe sliders," only a handful of American restaurants have been granted the privilege of selling the real thing. For years, Manhattan's 212 Steakhouse has been New York's plug to Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, where a special strain of Wagyu cattle is bred for their intricately marbled fat. Exceptionally tender and ridiculously hard to come by, authentic Kobe beef lives up to the legend. At 212, a tasting of Kobe cuts—ribeye, striploin, and tenderloin—goes for $205.

<media:description>Sean Evans is no Iron Chef. Despite a superhuman ability to eat ultra-spicy chicken wings, our host is barely able to scramble an egg on his own. But in the hopes of finally unlocking the keys to the perfect steak-and-potato dinner, Sean has wisely enlisted the help of renowned meat maestro Angie Mar. As the owner of the Beatrice Inn, Mar has quickly established her restaurant as a haven for red-blooded beef-lovers throughout NYC. Will Sean become Mar's new steak-obsessed protege, or succumb to #RawMeatGate and overcook his ribeye like a rookie? Watch the latest episode of Sean in the Wild and find out.

<media:description>Before he ate 600+ wings of death on Hot Ones, Sean Evans attempted to eat like The Rock for a day. The challenge began in 2015 when Muscle &amp; Fitness published Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's diet, which involves seven meals that weigh in at an insane 10lbs of food. We came across the clip when we were digging in the Complex video vaults and thought we'd share it with fans who may have missed Sean's earliest foray into the world of eating like an idiot. Enjoy!

<media:description>Welcome to Food Grails, a new First We Feast travel series hosted by Miss Info. As a music journalist, she's travelled the world and seen the power of artists who rep for their hometown sound. Now, she wants to discover how foods define a city’s flavor—from Atlanta's lemon-pepper wings, to NYC's beef patties. These are America’s food grails.

In episode 2, Miss Info investigates how the Jamaican beef patty became a NYC icon. As the flaky meat turnover has infiltrated all aspects of city life—found in mom-and-pop bakeries, bodegas, pizza shops, and even street carts—the patty itself has inspired fierce debate. Because if you think a patty is a patty is a patty...well, you're dead wrong. From heated conversations with DJ Clark Kent, to philosophical musings in the back of a Rolls Royce with Upscale Vandal, here are what New Yorkers really have to say about the beef patty.

<media:description>If you're a fan of Japanese street food, few things are are more satisfying than a stack of takoyaki—golf ball-sized pockets of dough commonly filled with diced octopus, green onion, and pickled ginger. Otafuku in NYC’s East Village makes some of the best takoyaki outside of Japan, using a special, vibrating pan to perfectly crisp the outside of each octopus-stuffed ball. Topped with mayonnaise, bonito flakes, and a savory, umami-packed sauce, takoyaki is the perfect snack for Japanese food junkies.

<media:description>L.A.'s Eggslut has become the holy grail for breakfast-sandwich aficionados, offering one of the country's most Instagrammable hangover cures. In this episode of SITW, Sean Evans stops by chef Alvin Cailin's new Eggslut pop-up at Chefs Club Counter in New York City to test-drive some of the most popular B.E.C.s on the market (can you guess which is which?!), then hops into the kitchen to learn the art of the perfect egg sandwich.

<media:description>New York is a city full of pizza purists. If a pie isn't flat, round, and dripping with grease, NYC slice obsessives are likely to turn their noses up at it. But in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, one restaurant is making waves with a style of pizza not from the five boroughs, but the Midwest. True to its name, Emmy Squared specializes in the thick, rectangular pies found in Detroit, Michigan, crisping its focaccia-like crust and fresh mozzarella cheese in small, squarish pans. The brainchild of Matt and Emily Hyland—the power couple behind the popular Neapolitan pie joint, Pizza Loves Emily—Emmy Squared is out to broaden the definition of pizza in NYC.

<media:description>Welcome to Food Grails, a new First We Feast travel series hosted by Miss Info. As a music journalist, she's travelled the world and seen the power of artists who rep for their hometown sound. Now, she wants to discover how foods define a city’s flavor—from Atlanta's lemon-pepper wings, to NYC's beef patties. These are America’s food grails.

In episode 1, Miss Info meets a group of young, charismatic African-American entrepreneurs from Watts, South L.A, and Compton who are shaking up the taco scene, finding new meaning in L.A.’s iconic street food. Find out how upstarts like All Flavor No Grease and Taco Mell are making a name for themselves, and why rapper Casey Veggies says, "The food game turned into the rap game."

<media:description>Sushi isn't part of the regular Sean Evans diet, but he's ready to broaden his horizons. To understand the art of omakase—a meal in which diners allow a sushi chef to determine what they eat—Sean visits Kiriko in Los Angeles with comedian and raw-fish connoisseur Andy Milonakis.

<media:description>For over a decade, ramen has more or less dominated the Japanese noodle game in New York City. But late last year, Japan's renowned TsuruTonTan opened its first U.S. location in Manhattan, drawing attention to a noodle typically overlooked by American diners: udon. Known for its plump and chewy texture, udon has been a staple of Japanese cuisine for a millennium. Thanks to TsuruTonTan—and a glowing review from Pete Wells in The New York Times—New Yorkers have finally started to expand their noodle horizons. Dunked in a slew of savory broths, and topped with ingredients like wagyu beef and sea urchin, TsuruTonTan's noodles are leading the udon revolution in NYC.

<media:description>Few chefs are more synonymous with meat than April Bloomfield. As the mastermind behind NYC gastropubs The Spotted Pig and The Breslin, Bloomfield helped push the limits of the hamburger in the five boroughs. Now, having finally opened her first patty-centric restaurant—Salvation Burger on 51st Street—the Michelin-starred chef has been able to further hone her meaty craft. To Bloomfield, burger nirvana comes down to balance: a fatty, steak-like patty, a thick slab of beer cheese, and hearty layer of smoked bacon. Available seasonally, grab this version of the Salvation Burger before it vanishes permanently.

<media:description>Sean Evans rides hard for his beloved Chicago deep dish, but regional pride can't blind him for the glories of a perfect New York pie. To better understand the legacy of Brooklyn pizza, he enlists the help of slice sherpa Paul Giannone—owner of Paulie Gee's in Greenpoint—to introduce him to some of the borough's old-school pizza joints. They end the tour back at Paulie Gee's to make a special Neapolitan pie fit for a spicy-food connoisseur like Sean.

<media:description>To the uninitiated, squid ink is an ingredient best left to an episode of “Fear Factor”—a viscous goop that can turn foods jet-black and fishy with the smallest drop. But for those who’ve come to appreciate the rich, oceanic flavor of the ingredient, there are few dishes more appealing than Dale Talde’s squid-ink pappardelle with blue crab and vodka sauce at Massoni. Though seasonings like Old Bay and adobo might not show up in your Italian grandmother’s recipe, the pasta bridges the gap between Talde’s Filipino-American upbringing and the coast of Sicily.

<media:description>You might not recognize DJ Snake walking down the street, but as soon as you hear his discography, the light bulbs go off.

Watch him test his North African spice tolerance against the wings of death, while Sean Evans grills him on everything from DJ beef, to why he hates his stage name.

<media:description>In this edition of "Food Skills," we head to NYC's Robataya, where chef Yu-Jin Tsugehara gives us a master class in the art of Japanese robatayaki. Popularized in the Sendai region of Japan, the traditional cooking method features seasonal skewers grilled over a special charcoal called bincho-tan. The chefs command a central hearth, and are surrounded by a bed of fresh seafood and vegetables. At Robataya, the preparation is as memorable as the meal.

<media:description>In this edition of "Food Skills," we take you on a special, behind-the-scenes tour of NYC's first Ikinari Steak, the Japanese restaurant chain famous for making its customers stand while they dine. Serving high-quality cuts of beef at an affordable price, the steakhouse lays its wet-aged meat on a bed of corn before dousing it in a secret, umami-rich soy sauce. With steaming sirloins whizzing back-and-forth, Ikinari Steak is Japan's flame-grilled answer to The Sizzler.

<media:description>In this edition of "Food Skills," chef Angie Mar of Beatrice Inn shows us the brontosaurus-size tomahawk steak that she's serving up as part of the restaurant's meaty Sunday service. The massive hunk of 60-day dry-aged meat is trimmed, liberally salted, blasted with heat in the oven, and then served on a huge wooden board. Watching the steak being carved is a beautiful sight to behold.

<media:description>Brett Baker has long been known to Hot Ones fans for his "Power Rankings" on Twitter. Now, he's known to the Internet at large as the subject of Russell Brand's impromptu Hot Ones musical performance, delivered in the throes of Blair's Mega Death Sauce with Liquid Rage. Before the episode came out, we warned Brett to expect something special and film himself watching it for the first time. Here are the results.

<media:description>In what may be the greatest tour de force in Hot Ones history, comedian and truthsayer Russell Brand transforms from a spice novice to a full-on capsaicin junkie while facing the wings of death. After bantering with host Sean Evans about everything from visiting Donald Trump's tower to being a West Ham United super fan, Brand finds that his consciousness is awakened by the hot sauce. Eventually, he's moved to freestyle an impromptu song for a very special Hot Ones fan. You don't want to miss this!

<media:description>At Howlin' Ray's in L.A.'s Chinatown, chef Johnny Zone and his wife Amanda have created a sensation with their Nashville-style hot chicken, which regularly attracts hour-long lines of poultry-loving spice fiends. There are six advertised heat levels—so, needless to say, Hot Ones host Sean Evans had to go try the off-menu level seven, which is packed with Carolina Reaper. Watch him struggle through the fire with comedian Brian Redban.

<media:description>In this edition of "Food Skills," we head to Old Tbilisi Garden in Greenwich Village, one of the few restaurants in New York City to serve traditional Georgian cuisine. The highlight of the menu is a bread-shaped boat of cheese and egg yolk called khachapuri adjaruli. To make the classic dish, a mound of slightly sour sulguni is stuffed inside butter-brushed dough, before being left to brown and bubble in the oven.

<media:description>On this week's special edition of Empty Calories, it's the YouTube collaboration you've been waiting for: Hot-sauce guy Sean Evans teams up with fast-food maven Daym Drops for a taste-test of some of the most popular spicy dishes currently heating up chain menus. Watch the duo combine their superpowers to rate newcomers like the Burger King Jalapeño Chicken Fries, and OGs like the Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich.

<media:description>In this edition of "Food Skills," we take a look at the real-deal Mexican street-food vendor Los Tacos No. 1 in Chelsea Market. The signature taco--which, if you ask us, is the city's best--is the adobada, a Northern Mexican cousin to al pastor. The tortillas are pressed from fresh masa and puffed up on the griddle, and the red-chili-marinated pork is expertly shaved off a glistening spit before getting topped with sweet pineapple.

<media:description>As he seeks to "shamelessly promote" his new movie "Fist Fight" (Feb 17), actor Charlie Day submits to the Sean Evans-led onslaught of hot wings and even hotter questions. Through the emotional highs and lows of Zombie Apocalypse and Mad Dog 357, the "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Star" weighs in on everything from Zac Efron's neighborliness, to the most iconic regional foods of Rhode Island. Kitten mittens!

<media:description>Here it is, fresh out the oven: Empty Calories episode 4, a new series from First We Feast that dissects the bizarre, over-the-top world of food in 2017. We couldn't afford a house band or Chance the Rapper for our first musical guest, but we came close: Fatboy SSE freestyling his McDonald's order, with accompaniment from beatboxing legend Chesney Snow. Plus: Sean and Ellie take a look at the week in Internet idiocy.

<media:description>In this edition of "Food Skills," we head to Socarrat for an up-close look at the Spanish art of paella-making. The term socarrat refers to the crust that forms on the bottom of a paella pan during cooking—those crunchy bits of seafood- and sausage-infused rice are widely considered the most delicious part of the dish.

<media:description>Just in time for the return of David Brent in "Life on the Road" (February 10 on Netflix), Ricky Gervais steps into the hot seat for the (vegan) wings of death and some scorching questions from First We Feast's Sean Evans. Accurately dubbing Hot Ones "a cross between Charlie Rose and f*%king Jackass," the comedian gets pummeled by the likes of Zombie Apocalypse and Da Bomb Beyond Insanity. Will he become "entertainment for some idiot on the Internet"? Will he "vomit and sh*t" himself? You gotta watch to find out!

<media:description>Welcome to episode 3 of Empty Calories, a new series from First We Feast that dissects the bizarre, over-the-top world of food in 2017. This week, Sean Evans and Ellie Lee dig into Gordon Ramsay's soft side, underrated snack raps by Migos, and the impropriety of slanging weed out of the Burger King drive-thru. Plus: a very special cameo from Nick Cannon, who drops in for a rousing ode to Waffle House.

<media:description>In this edition of "Food Skills," we head to Tut's Hub Royal Cuisine in Astoria, Queens, for a look at an Egyptian dish that needs your immediate attention. Feteer brings to mind a mix between a stuffed pizza and a flaky pastry. The acrobatic spinning yields a super-thin dough that's wrapped in layers around fillings of your choice—both savory (cheese, olives, sausage, pastrami) and sweet (custard, honey, nuts). 

Visit Tut's Hub Royal Cuisine at 30-91 Steinway Street, Astoria, Queens (718-932-8000, tutshub.com)

<media:description>Detroit rapper Danny Brown is one of the most requested guests by Hot Ones fans. And guess what? You guys were onto something. The energetic MC is a hilarious, highly combustible match for the wings of death. In between painful fits of laughter, he manages to share some top-shelf anecdotes about the Gathering of the Juggalos, 50 Cent's fashion tips, and his beloved cats.

<media:description>Joey "Coco" Diaz, the man Joe Rogan calls the funniest comic of all time, brings his F-bomb-heavy swagger—as well as a side of blue cheese—to First We Feast's spicy-wing challenge. As he sweats profusely through the pain, he manages to deliver some incredible anecdotes about getting bitten by dogs and eating edibles with Bert Kreischer's dad. This is classic Hot Ones!

<media:description>Welcome to the inaugural episode of "Empty Calories," a new series from First We Feast that dissects the bizarre, over-the-top world of food culture in 2017. Every Tuesday at 11 a.m., co-hosts Sean Evans and Ellie Lee dredge up the week's most ridiculous culinary clips—from the reality T.V. absurdity of the Food Network, to the face palm-inducing cooking fails circulating around social media. In our first installment, Sean and Ellie brave an extremely uncomfortable Rachael Ray segment, watch Rick Ross achieve the true pinnacle of success, and duke it out over fast-food French fries.

<media:description>In this episode of “Food Skills,” we visit Japanese comfort-food specialists Hi-Collar in NYC for a look at omurice, a popular dish that consists of an omelet served over a mound of rice. While the final products looks simple, the art of cooking omurice is leaving the inside of the omelet extra gooey so that it spills out over the rice when cut open. The climactic slice is all part of the experience.

<media:description>The wait is over, Hot Ones fans! Sean Evans and the wings of death are back in action for another season, and we're kicking things off with an extra-special guest who is practically synonymous with spice: the one, the only Padma Lakshmi. The Top Chef host, model, and author of The Encyclopedia of Spices and Herbs goes wing-for-wing and dab-for-dab with Sean while discussing everything from her friendship with Shaq, to the most appetizing animal testicles in the game.

<media:description>From the breakout success of "White Iverson," to a guest spot on Justin Bieber's blockbuster Purpose Tour, Post Malone can't stop winning. Now, as he prepares to drop his debut album, "Stoney," on 12/9, he risks it all by taking down a platter of dangerously spicy wings. In the process, he offers some top-shelf animal anecdotes, a very hot In-N-Out take, and a working definition of "sauce." Let's get weird. 

We're finally here to supply you with the dopest merch! We sell everything from Hot Ones Hot Sauce like the The Last Dab to the highest quality tees. Shop here: https://bit.ly/2w8lVer

<media:description>In what can safely be described as the most adult episode of Hot Ones to date (well, at least a good deal more adult than when Bobby Lee pooped his pants), James Beard Award-winning chef Tom Colicchio covers everything from the national hunger epidemic, to the problems with tipping. The Bravo vet also tackles some Top Chef quickfire and teaches Sean how to properly judge a dangerously hot chicken wing.

<media:description>R&amp;B kingpin T-Pain may give Bert Kreischer a run for his money as the biggest Hot Ones fan to come on the show. Having watched every episode ("I'm a Redditor," he explained to Sean before the taping), the hitmaker entered the challenge with a few theories about how to survive wings of death. Did any of them serve him well against the likes of Da Bomb and Blair's Mega Death Sauce with Liquid Rage? Watch and find out.

<media:description>First We Feast is proud to present our first documentary, "Hometown Hero: The Legend of New York's Chopped Cheese."

To understand the real New York, you've got to understand the chopped cheese. So, what exactly is a chopped cheese?

On the surface, that would seem simple. The bodega specialty gets its name from the "chopping" of hamburger patties, which occurs on the griddles in delis throughout Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Harlem. The minced meat is covered in cheese, slipped into a roll or hero, and dressed with standard-issue condiments.

But when we began to peel back the layers and ask questions about its origin story, how it became so popular, and why it's so difficult to find one in lower Manhattan, we were introduced to a much deeper tale fueled by borough rivalries, hip-hop mythology, and hard-to-swallow truths, giving us a more meaningful glimpse into what makes this city tick.

"Hometown Hero: The Legend of New York's Chopped Cheese" gives you a chance to hear directly from New Yorkers—such as cooking collective Ghetto Gastro, rapper Bodega Bamz, and humorist Jeffrey Almonte—who want to protect the sandwich from outsiders, re-mix it in professional kitchens, or simply remind you that there's more to this sandwich than meets the eye. 

Hometown Heroes won Best Short Film, Audience Choice, and Best Filmmaker at the 2017 NYC Food Film Festival.

<media:description>You asked for him, and now he's here: Mr. Wonderful in the Hot Ones studio. The host of Viceland's "F**k That's Delicious" smokes and drinks his way through the Scoville onslaught, tackling questions about everything from on-stage body slams to legendary TV chefs along the way. And don't worry: There's a Big Body Bes cameo, just as you knew there would be.

<media:description>It's a historic day at Hot Ones: The first-ever live edition of Hot Ones, coming at you from the cultural mega-fest ComplexCon in Long Beach, CA. If you think the wings are fake or Sean Evans is a CGI character cobbled together by editors, maybe this will put your mind at ease? Either way, you'll get a pretty great interview with skateboarding legend Tony Hawk, so tune in.

<media:description>The comedian and actor Bobby Lee puts in one of the most outrageous—and outrageously funny—Hot Ones performances to date. As he battles the onslaught of Scovilles, he reminisces about his Mad TV days, rates the most iconic short-shorts, and tries (perhaps unsuccessfully?) to not lose control of his mind and his bowels.

<media:description>At just age 20, Martin Garrix is already an international superstar. His single with Bebe Rexha, "In the Name of Love," is tearing up the charts. He jet sets around the world playing to massive festival crowds. And he was just named DJ Mag's #1 DJ in the entire world. So it only makes sense that the Dutch sensation would become the first DJ to step into the Hot Ones arena and submit to some spicy wings and burning questions from Sean Evans. Let the beat drop...

<media:description>As his history-making comedy special What Now? hits theaters, the biggest comedian in the game joins the biggest Internet wings show in the game for an extra-hot interview. Kevin Hart damn near loses his mind on the hot sauce, but that doesn't stop him from peppering in some motivational speeches, cracking jokes about DJ Khaled, and regaling Sean with some hilarious anecdotes about working at a male strip club. In Hart's own words, "We out here!"

<media:description>Being an NFL Pro Bowler is sure evidence that Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is tough as nails. Starring in an E! Entertainment Television reality dating show called "Catching Kelce" is evidence that he is also down to make suspect decisions in the name of good #content. And so, it only made sense to invite Kelce into the Hot Ones studio to take on the 10 wings of death and answer some burning questions from host Sean Evans. Strap in—we haven't seen this much willpower exerted on the show since Gronk stepped up to the challenge.

<media:description>Epic Meal Time honcho Harley Morenstein is a YouTube O.G. and decorated veteran of the "do dumb shit for the Internet" game. But how is he with spicy wings?

<media:description>A year ago, Danish pepper-eating legend Chili Klaus joined Hot Ones host Sean Evans to take on the Carolina Reaper, the world's spiciest chili pepper. Now, the Scovilles-fueled bromance continues on a horse-a day-carriage ride in Central Park, which takes a bizarre and painful turn when the pair decide to crack open a mystery package from their fiendish friend "Smokin' Ed" Currie of PuckerButt Pepper Company in Fort Mill, SC.

Turns out he's also a beast when it comes to hot sauce (by his own account, he used to drink it by the bottle). Watch the SNL alum take on some of the spiciest wings on the planet while discussing Drake's after-parties, Kevin Hart's abs, and the Michelle Obama's rhymes.

Smith, Denzel Washington, Shannon Sharpe, Jay Z, Eddie Murphy, and even Smeagol from Lord of the Rings while tasting our signature hot sauce.

<media:description>Wu-Tang Clan sensei RZA and Interpol frontman Paul Banks have been making music together since 2011, but they haven't really tested the bonds of their relationship until now, when Banks dragged RZA into the Hot Ones studio without telling him what was in store. Of course, the Abbot has plenty of Shaolin powers to draw upon while facing down the Scoville sword style of Pain 100% and Mad Dog 357. Find out how the pair do against five wings of death in this week's HOT ONES.

<media:description>On the Eric Andre Show, comedian Eric Andre takes the format of late-night TV shows and flips it on its head, turning his set into a gonzo celebrity dystopia full of vermin and vomit. So, needless to say, we were curious to see what he'd make of our ridiculous interview format, where each question is accompanied by an increasingly spicy chicken wing. His take on the experience: "This is a nightmare, dude."

<media:description>Comedian and Ballers star Rob Corddry would like to add another honorific to his resume: "wing-enjoyer." At least that's what he thought going into First We Feast's Hot Ones, in which host Sean Evans challenges his celebrity guests to answer questions while they tackle 10 progressively spicier wings. While he had no problem recounting stories from The Daily Show and Childrens Hospital while taking down Sriracha and Tapatio, Corddry finds his wits tested as the sauces climb the Scoville scale.

<media:description>Kanye has always taught us to "listen to the kids, bro!" So when First We Feast launched it's second annual #KanyeIceCreamWeek at Morgenstern's in NYC, we took 'Ye's advice and set up a taste taste with the most qualified frozen-treats critics we could find: a bunch of little kids. See what they think of items like the Bound 2 Banana Split, Panda Cone, and Nori Shake, then head to Morgenstern's (2 Rivington St, NYC) until June 2 to try them for yourself.

<media:description>As he drops his second book, Double Cup Love, and takes his global food show, Huang's World, to TV with Viceland, Eddie Huang's got plenty of swagger to spare—perhaps TOO much swagger. Watch him pull one of the boldest moves in Hot Ones history, then suffer the very real consequences. The Baohaus owner also issues hot takes on the whitewashing of food media, discusses his relationship with Anthony Bourdain, and explains why Future should be in your top five. It's a Hot Ones challenge for the ages...

Watch Eddie attempt the Hot Ones challenge again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r21JqtL53DI

<media:description>In episode 6 of "That's Odd, Let's Drink It," Dogfish Head founder Sam Calagione joins forces with GQ's Best New Menswear Designers in America, Emil and Sandy Corsillo of the Hill-Side, to brew something extra special for the grand opening of their new flagship store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 

The goal? To merge the process of making clothes and making beer by utilizing edible, all-natural dyes that can be deployed in both fabric and liquid. To bring their experiment to life, they team up with beloved local brewers Other Half to create a saison that's a blank canvas for two colorful additions: carrot and blueberry. Which hue reigns supreme is ultimately decided by the guests at the Hill-side launch party.

Brought to you by First We Feast, "That's Odd, Let's Drink It" is a six-part series that explores that outer boundaries of experimental brewing. In each episode, Sam Calagione will create a never-before-seen beer inspired by an icon in another field—from culinary giant Mario Batali, to NBA superstar Chris Bosh.

<media:description>In the first season of Hot Ones, host Sean Evans proved that there's no wing he can't handle. But the world of spicy foods doesn't end at Mad Dog 357 hot sauce. To train for Season 2 and ensure his invisibility on the Hot Ones stage, Sean met up with a true legend of the chili world—Denmark's ghost-pepper-popping Chili Klaus—to take on the hottest chili pepper known to man, the Carolina Reaper. Special thanks to "Smokin' Ed" Currie of PuckerButt Pepper Company in South Carolina for providing the heat.

<media:description>After collaborating on the song "Sushi," Asher Roth and Fat Tony are ready to put their raw-fish obsession to the test. First We Feast brought the two MCs together in Los Angeles for a blind tasting of (mostly) cheap sushi, then asked them to rate and review the offerings from Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Sugarfish, and more. Some of the sushi they encountered was fresh as hell—some not so much.

**********

Tex Mex Dumpling Recipe
 
Makes about 10 dumplings, depending on size
 
Ingredients
 
For the dumplings:
Around 10 4-inch dumpling wrappers
3 tablespoons salsa
3 tablespoons grated cheddar
¼ cup crumbled tortilla chips
Dash hot sauce
10 ounces ground pork
1 tablespoon sour cream
Scant ½ teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons chopped green chilies
2 tablespoons soy sauce
Canola or safflower or peanut oil
 
For the sauce:
¼ cup sour cream
2 tablespoons salsa
1 tablespoon soy sauce
Hot sauce
 
Make the filling
In a large bowl, combine salsa, cheese, crumbled tortilla chips, hot sauce, pork, sour cream, salt, green chilies, and soy sauce. Mix to combine.

Wrap the dumplings
Arrange 10 or so wrappers out on the counter. Place about 2 teaspoons of filling at the center of each dumpling wrapper. Rub water along the outline of the wrapper. As you fold the two sides together, pick the dumpling up in your hands and make little pleats to seal them together. You can also just leave them on the counter, fold one side over the other, and seal with a fork. Repeat with more wrappers and more filling til you’ve made as many dumplings as you want.
 
Cook the dumplings
Film a skillet with about a tablespoon of oil and warm over high heat. When the oil is shimmering, arrange the dumplings in the pan as close as they will fit without touching. Cook until the bottoms have turned brown and golden. Pour 3 tablespoons of water into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat, take off the lid, check one dumpling to be sure the pork is cooked, and use a spatula to life each dumpling from the pan. Repeat with as many more batches as you want to eat, wiping out the pan and adding more oil as needed.
 
Make the sauce &amp; eat
Stir together the soy sauce, hot sauce, salsa, and sour cream for the sauce. Fill another little bowl with soy sauce if you’d like. Arrange the dumplings on a plate and dip dumplings into both sauces before eating.

<media:title>Anthony Rizzo On Chicago Cubs Rivalries &amp; Baseball Superstitions While Eating Spicy Wings | Hot Ones</media:title>

<media:description>Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo is a legitimate powerhouse on the baseball diamond—a 6 foot 3, 240 pound all-star who knocked in 32 home runs last year.

It's obvious he can handle the fastball—but what about the heat from a cayenne pepper sauce?

In "Hot Ones," we test Rizzo's limits by asking him progressively tougher questions paired with progressively spicier wings.

Check out the video above to see him duke it out with host Sean Evans while discussing trash-talk from Cardinals fans, post-game fast-food munchies, and whether Slim Shady rocked bleached hair better than he did.

<media:description>To celebrate the release of his debut album, B4.Da.$$, rapper Joey Bada$$ heads to Brooklyn-based chicken-and-waffles joint Sweet Chick to hang out with proprietor John Seymour. The duo decides to turn "Curry Chicken"—Joey's favorite childhood dish, and the title of one of his new songs—into a brand-new Sweet Chick dish. They're so pleased with the results that they host a party and impromptu performance at the restaurant to share it with friends—but not before the "Bada$$ Waffle" gets the seal of approval from the Joey's mom.

Visit Sweet Chick to try the "Bada$$ Waffle until February 26: http://sweetchicknyc.com/
